3	2009-11-17 10:30:00	One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
4	2009-11-17 11:00:00	He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly,
5	2009-11-17 11:30:00	slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
6	2009-11-17 12:00:00	The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.
7	2009-11-17 12:30:00	His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.
8	2009-11-18 09:00:00	
9	2009-11-18 09:30:00	"What's happened to me?" he thought.
10	2009-11-18 10:00:00	It wasn't a dream.
11	2009-11-18 10:30:00	His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.
12	2009-11-18 11:00:00	A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman -
13	2009-11-18 11:30:00	and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.
14	2009-11-18 12:00:00	It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright,
15	2009-11-18 12:30:00	raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.
16	2009-11-19 09:00:00	
17	2009-11-19 09:30:00	Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.
18	2009-11-19 10:00:00	Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.
19	2009-11-19 10:30:00	"How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense", he thought,
20	2009-11-19 11:00:00	but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his right,
21	2009-11-19 11:30:00	and in his present state couldn't get into that position.
22	2009-11-19 12:00:00	However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was.
23	2009-11-19 12:30:00	He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs,
24	2009-11-19 13:00:00	and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before.
25	2009-11-20 09:00:00	
26	2009-11-20 09:30:00	"Oh, God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've chosen!
27	2009-11-20 10:00:00	Travelling day in and day out.
28	2009-11-20 10:30:00	Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of travelling,
29	2009-11-20 11:00:00	worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food,
30	2009-11-20 11:30:00	contact with different people all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them.
31	2009-11-20 12:00:00	It can all go to Hell!" He felt a slight itch up on his belly;
32	2009-11-20 12:30:00	pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his head better;
33	2009-11-20 13:00:00	found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn't know what to make of;
34	2009-11-20 13:30:00	and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder.
35	2009-11-21 09:00:00	
36	2009-11-21 09:30:00	He slid back into his former position.
37	2009-11-21 10:00:00	"Getting up early all the time", he thought, "it makes you stupid.
38	2009-11-21 10:30:00	You've got to get enough sleep.
39	2009-11-21 11:00:00	Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury.
40	2009-11-21 11:30:00	For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract,
41	2009-11-21 12:00:00	these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts.
42	2009-11-21 12:30:00	I ought to just try that with my boss;
43	2009-11-21 13:00:00	I'd get kicked out on the spot.
44	2009-11-21 13:30:00	But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me.
45	2009-11-21 14:00:00	If I didn't have my parents to think about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago,
46	2009-11-21 14:30:00	I'd have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel.
47	2009-11-21 15:00:00	He'd fall right off his desk!
48	2009-11-21 15:30:00	And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,
49	2009-11-21 16:00:00	especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing.
50	2009-11-21 16:30:00	Well, there's still some hope;
51	2009-11-21 17:00:00	once I've got the money together to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five or six years I suppose - that's definitely what I'll do.
52	2009-11-21 17:30:00	That's when I'll make the big change.
53	2009-11-21 18:00:00	First of all though, I've got to get up, my train leaves at five."
54	2009-11-22 09:00:00	
55	2009-11-22 09:30:00	And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.
56	2009-11-22 10:00:00	"God in Heaven!" he thought.
57	2009-11-22 10:30:00	It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven.
58	2009-11-22 11:00:00	Had the alarm clock not rung?
59	2009-11-22 11:30:00	He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as it should have been;
60	2009-11-22 12:00:00	it certainly must have rung.
61	2009-11-22 12:30:00	Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise?
62	2009-11-22 13:00:00	True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that.
63	2009-11-22 13:30:00	What should he do now?
64	2009-11-22 14:00:00	The next train went at seven;
65	2009-11-22 14:30:00	if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed,
66	2009-11-22 15:00:00	and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and lively.
67	2009-11-22 15:30:00	And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his boss's anger
68	2009-11-22 15:30:00	as the office assistant would have been there to see the five o'clock train go,
69	2009-11-22 16:00:00	he would have put in his report about Gregor's not being there a long time ago.
70	2009-11-22 16:30:00	The office assistant was the boss's man, spineless, and with no understanding.
71	2009-11-22 17:00:00	What about if he reported sick?
72	2009-11-22 17:30:00	But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service Gregor had never once yet been ill.
73	2009-11-22 18:00:00	His boss would certainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy son,
74	2009-11-22 18:30:00	and accept the doctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy.
75	2009-11-22 19:00:00	And what's more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case?
76	2009-11-22 19:30:00	Gregor did in fact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.
77	2009-11-23 09:00:00	
78	2009-11-23 09:30:00	He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven.
79	2009-11-23 10:00:00	There was a cautious knock at the door near his head.
80	2009-11-23 10:30:00	"Gregor", somebody called - it was his mother - "it's quarter to seven.
81	2009-11-23 11:00:00	Didn't you want to go somewhere?" That gentle voice!
82	2009-11-23 11:30:00	Gregor was shocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had before.
83	2009-11-23 12:00:00	As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it,
84	2009-11-23 12:30:00	the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear,
85	2009-11-23 13:00:00	leaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not.
86	2009-11-23 13:30:00	Gregor had wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the circumstances contented himself with saying: "Yes, mother, yes,
87	2009-11-23 14:00:00	thank-you, I'm getting up now." The change in Gregor's voice probably could not be noticed outside through the wooden door,
88	2009-11-23 14:30:00	as his mother was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away.
89	2009-11-23 15:00:00	But this short conversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor, against their expectations was still at home,
90	2009-11-23 15:30:00	and soon his father came knocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist.
91	2009-11-23 16:00:00	"Gregor, Gregor", he called, "what's wrong?" And after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in his voice: "Gregor!
92	2009-11-23 16:30:00	Gregor!" At the other side door his sister came plaintively: "Gregor?
93	2009-11-23 17:00:00	Aren't you well?
94	2009-11-23 17:30:00	Do you need anything?" Gregor answered to both sides: "I'm ready, now",
95	2009-11-23 18:00:00	making an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each,
96	2009-11-23 18:30:00	individual word.
97	2009-11-23 19:00:00	His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister whispered: "Gregor, open the door, I beg of you." Gregor, however,
98	2009-11-23 19:30:00	had no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling,
99	2009-11-23 20:00:00	of locking all doors at night even when he was at home.
100	2009-11-24 09:00:00	
101	2009-11-24 09:30:00	The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast.
102	2009-11-24 10:00:00	Only then would he consider what to do next,
103	2009-11-24 10:30:00	as he was well aware that he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed.
104	2009-11-24 11:00:00	He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly,
105	2009-11-24 11:30:00	but that had always turned out to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve themselves today.
106	2009-11-24 12:00:00	He did not have the slightest doubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold,
107	2009-11-24 12:30:00	which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.
108	2009-11-25 09:00:00	
109	2009-11-25 09:30:00	It was a simple matter to throw off the covers;
110	2009-11-25 10:00:00	he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves.
111	2009-11-25 10:30:00	But it became difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad.
112	2009-11-25 11:00:00	He would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up;
113	2009-11-25 11:30:00	but instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in different directions,
114	2009-11-25 12:00:00	and which he was moreover unable to control.
115	2009-11-25 12:30:00	If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would stretch itself out;
116	2009-11-25 13:00:00	and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully.
117	2009-11-25 13:30:00	"This is something that can't be done in bed", Gregor said to himself, "so don't keep trying to do it".
118	2009-11-26 09:00:00	
119	2009-11-26 09:30:00	The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part,
120	2009-11-26 10:00:00	and could not imagine what it looked like;
121	2009-11-26 10:30:00	it turned out to be too hard to move;
122	2009-11-26 11:00:00	it went so slowly;
123	2009-11-26 11:30:00	and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather,
124	2009-11-26 12:00:00	he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost,
125	2009-11-26 12:30:00	and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.
126	2009-11-27 09:00:00	
127	2009-11-27 09:30:00	So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first, carefully turning his head to the side.
128	2009-11-27 10:00:00	This he managed quite easily, and despite its breadth and its weight,
129	2009-11-27 10:30:00	the bulk of his body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head.
130	2009-11-27 11:00:00	But when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it
131	2009-11-27 11:00:00	occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not injured,
132	2009-11-27 11:30:00	so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the same way.
133	2009-11-27 12:00:00	And he could not knock himself out now at any price;
134	2009-11-27 12:30:00	better to stay in bed than lose consciousness.
135	2009-11-28 09:00:00	
136	2009-11-28 09:30:00	It took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier, but when he lay there sighing,
137	2009-11-28 10:00:00	and was once more watching his legs as they struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was possible,
138	2009-11-28 10:30:00	he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this chaos.
139	2009-11-28 11:00:00	He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice.
140	2009-11-28 11:30:00	At the same time, though, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate conclusions.
141	2009-11-28 12:00:00	At times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, but unfortunately,
142	2009-11-28 12:30:00	even the other side of the narrow street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to offer him.
143	2009-11-28 13:00:00	"Seven o'clock, already", he said to himself when the clock struck again, "seven o'clock, and there's still a fog like this."
144	2009-11-28 13:30:00	And he lay there quietly a while longer,
145	2009-11-28 14:00:00	breathing lightly as if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and natural state.
146	2009-11-29 09:00:00	
147	2009-11-29 09:30:00	But then he said to himself: "Before it strikes quarter past seven I'll definitely have to have got properly out of bed.
148	2009-11-29 10:00:00	And by then somebody will have come round from work to ask what's happened to me as well, as they open up at work before seven o'clock."
149	2009-11-29 10:30:00	And so he set himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all at the same time.
150	2009-11-29 11:00:00	If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it.
151	2009-11-29 11:30:00	His back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet.
152	2009-11-29 12:00:00	His main concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make,
153	2009-11-29 12:30:00	and which even through all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm.
154	2009-11-29 13:00:00	But it was something that had to be risked.
155	2009-11-30 09:00:00	
156	2009-11-30 09:30:00	When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed - the new method was more of a game than an effort,
157	2009-11-30 10:00:00	all he had to do was rock back and forth - it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody came to help him.
158	2009-11-30 10:30:00	Two strong people - he had his father and the maid in mind - would have been more than enough;
159	2009-11-30 11:00:00	they would only have to push their arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed,
160	2009-11-30 11:30:00	bend down with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use.
161	2009-11-30 12:00:00	Should he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked?
162	2009-11-30 12:30:00	Despite all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile at this thought.
163	2009-12-01 09:00:00	
164	2009-12-01 09:30:00	After a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard.
165	2009-12-01 10:00:00	The time was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very soon.
166	2009-12-01 10:30:00	Then there was a ring at the door of the flat.
167	2009-12-01 11:00:00	"That'll be someone from work", he said to himself, and froze very still,
168	2009-12-01 11:30:00	although his little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around.
169	2009-12-01 12:00:00	For a moment everything remained quiet.
170	2009-12-01 12:30:00	"They're not opening the door", Gregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope.
171	2009-12-01 13:00:00	But then of course, the maid's firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.
172	2009-12-01 13:30:00	Gregor only needed to hear the visitor's first words of greeting and he knew who it was - the chief clerk himself.
173	2009-12-01 14:00:00	Why did Gregor have to be the only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming?
174	2009-12-01 14:30:00	Were all employees, every one of them, louts,
175	2009-12-01 15:00:00	was there not one of them who was faithful and devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he couldn't get out of bed if he didn't spend at least a couple of hours in the morning on company business?
176	2009-12-01 15:30:00	Was it really not enough to let one of the trainees make enquiries - assuming enquiries were even necessary -
177	2009-12-01 16:00:00	did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have to show the whole,
178	2009-12-01 16:30:00	innocent family that this was so suspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it?
179	2009-12-01 17:00:00	And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed.
180	2009-12-01 17:30:00	There was a loud thump, but it wasn't really a loud noise.
181	2009-12-01 18:00:00	His fall was softened a little by the carpet, and Gregor's back was also more elastic than he had thought,
182	2009-12-01 18:30:00	which made the sound muffled and not too noticeable.
183	2009-12-01 19:00:00	He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit it as he fell;
184	2009-12-01 19:30:00	annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet.
185	2009-12-02 09:00:00	
186	2009-12-02 09:30:00	"Something's fallen down in there", said the chief clerk in the room on the left.
187	2009-12-02 10:00:00	Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too;
188	2009-12-02 10:30:00	you had to concede that it was possible.
189	2009-12-02 11:00:00	But as if in gruff reply to this question,
190	2009-12-02 11:30:00	the chief clerk's firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room.
191	2009-12-02 12:00:00	From the room on his right, Gregor's sister whispered to him to let him know: "Gregor, the chief clerk is here." "Yes, I know",
192	2009-12-02 12:30:00	said Gregor to himself;
193	2009-12-02 13:00:00	but without daring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.
194	2009-12-03 09:00:00	
195	2009-12-03 09:30:00	"Gregor", said his father now from the room to his left,
196	2009-12-03 10:00:00	"the chief clerk has come round and wants to know why you didn't leave on the early train.
197	2009-12-03 10:30:00	We don't know what to say to him.
198	2009-12-03 11:00:00	And anyway, he wants to speak to you personally.
199	2009-12-03 11:30:00	So please open up this door.
200	2009-12-03 12:00:00	I'm sure he'll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room." Then the chief clerk called "Good morning, Mr. Samsa".
201	2009-12-03 12:30:00	"He isn't well", said his mother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through the door.
202	2009-12-03 13:00:00	"He isn't well, please believe me.
203	2009-12-03 13:30:00	Why else would Gregor have missed a train!
204	2009-12-03 14:00:00	The lad only ever thinks about the business.
205	2009-12-03 14:30:00	It nearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings;
206	2009-12-03 15:00:00	he's been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening.
207	2009-12-03 15:30:00	He sits with us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables.
208	2009-12-03 16:00:00	His idea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw.
209	2009-12-03 16:30:00	He's made a little frame, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you'll be amazed how nice it is;
210	2009-12-03 17:00:00	it's hanging up in his room;
211	2009-12-03 17:30:00	you'll see it as soon as Gregor opens the door.
212	2009-12-03 18:00:00	Anyway, I'm glad you're here;
213	2009-12-03 18:30:00	we wouldn't have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves;
214	2009-12-03 19:00:00	he's so stubborn;
215	2009-12-03 19:30:00	and I'm sure he isn't well, he said this morning that he is, but he isn't." "I'll be there in a moment",
216	2009-12-03 20:00:00	said Gregor slowly and thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word of the conversation.
217	2009-12-03 20:30:00	"Well I can't think of any other way of explaining it, Mrs. Samsa", said the chief clerk, "I hope it's nothing serious.
218	2009-12-03 21:00:00	But on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like,
219	2009-12-03 21:30:00	we simply have to overcome it because of business considerations." "Can the chief clerk come in to see you now then?",
220	2009-12-03 22:00:00	asked his father impatiently, knocking at the door again.
221	2009-12-03 22:30:00	"No", said Gregor.
222	2009-12-03 23:00:00	In the room on his right there followed a painful silence;
223	2009-12-03 23:30:00	in the room on his left his sister began to cry.
224	2009-12-04 09:00:00	
225	2009-12-04 09:30:00	So why did his sister not go and join the others?
226	2009-12-04 10:00:00	She had probably only just got up and had not even begun to get dressed.
227	2009-12-04 10:30:00	And why was she crying?
228	2009-12-04 11:00:00	Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief clerk in,
229	2009-12-04 11:30:00	because he was in danger of losing his job and if that happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same demands as before?
230	2009-12-04 12:00:00	There was no need to worry about things like that yet.
231	2009-12-04 12:30:00	Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family.
232	2009-12-04 13:00:00	For the time being he just lay there on the carpet,
233	2009-12-04 13:30:00	and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in.
234	2009-12-04 14:00:00	It was only a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later on,
235	2009-12-04 14:30:00	it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot.
236	2009-12-04 15:00:00	And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying.
237	2009-12-04 15:30:00	But the others didn't know what was happening, they were worried, that would excuse their behaviour.
238	2009-12-05 09:00:00	
239	2009-12-05 09:30:00	The chief clerk now raised his voice, "Mr. Samsa", he called to him, "what is wrong?
240	2009-12-05 10:00:00	You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more than yes or no for an answer,
241	2009-12-05 10:30:00	you are causing serious and unnecessary concern to your parents and you fail - and I mention this just by the way -
242	2009-12-05 11:00:00	you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite unheard of.
243	2009-12-05 11:30:00	I'm speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your employer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation.
244	2009-12-05 12:00:00	I am astonished, quite astonished.
245	2009-12-05 12:30:00	I thought I knew you as a calm and sensible person, and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims.
246	2009-12-05 13:00:00	This morning, your employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to appear, it's true -
247	2009-12-05 13:30:00	it had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to you -
248	2009-12-05 14:00:00	but I came near to giving him my word of honour that that could not be the right explanation.
249	2009-12-05 14:30:00	But now that I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish whatsoever to intercede on your behalf.
250	2009-12-05 15:00:00	And nor is your position all that secure.
251	2009-12-05 15:30:00	I had originally intended to say all this to you in private,
252	2009-12-05 16:00:00	but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason I don't see why your parents should not also learn of it.
253	2009-12-05 16:30:00	Your turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late;
254	2009-12-05 17:00:00	I grant you that it's not the time of year to do especially good business, we recognise that;
255	2009-12-05 17:30:00	but there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, Mr. Samsa, we cannot allow there to be."
256	2009-12-06 09:00:00	
257	2009-12-06 09:30:00	"But Sir", called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the excitement, "I'll open up immediately, just a moment.
258	2009-12-06 10:00:00	I'm slightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven't been able to get up.
259	2009-12-06 10:30:00	I'm still in bed now.
260	2009-12-06 11:00:00	I'm quite fresh again now, though.
261	2009-12-06 11:30:00	I'm just getting out of bed.
262	2009-12-06 12:00:00	Just a moment.
263	2009-12-06 12:30:00	Be patient!
264	2009-12-06 13:00:00	It's not quite as easy as I'd thought.
265	2009-12-06 13:30:00	I'm quite alright now, though.
266	2009-12-06 14:00:00	It's shocking, what can suddenly happen to a person!
267	2009-12-06 14:30:00	I was quite alright last night, my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last night already.
268	2009-12-06 15:00:00	They must have noticed it.
269	2009-12-06 15:30:00	I don't know why I didn't let you know at work!
270	2009-12-06 16:00:00	But you always think you can get over an illness without staying at home.
271	2009-12-06 16:30:00	Please, don't make my parents suffer!
272	2009-12-06 17:00:00	There's no basis for any of the accusations you're making;
273	2009-12-06 17:30:00	nobody's ever said a word to me about any of these things.
274	2009-12-06 18:00:00	Maybe you haven't read the latest contracts I sent in.
275	2009-12-06 18:30:00	I'll set off with the eight o'clock train, as well, these few hours of rest have given me strength.
276	2009-12-06 19:00:00	You don't need to wait, sir;
277	2009-12-06 19:30:00	I'll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good as to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him!"
278	2009-12-07 09:00:00	
279	2009-12-07 09:30:00	And while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was saying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers -
280	2009-12-07 10:00:00	this was easily done, probably because of the practise he had already had in bed - where he now tried to get himself upright.
281	2009-12-07 10:30:00	He really did want to open the door, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief clerk;
282	2009-12-07 11:00:00	the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him.
283	2009-12-07 11:30:00	If they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor's responsibility and he could rest.
284	2009-12-07 12:00:00	If, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason to be upset,
285	2009-12-07 12:30:00	and if he hurried he really could be at the station for eight o'clock.
286	2009-12-07 13:00:00	The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again,
287	2009-12-07 13:30:00	but he finally gave himself one last swing and stood there upright;
288	2009-12-07 14:00:00	the lower part of his body was in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it.
289	2009-12-07 14:30:00	Now he let himself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it with his little legs.
290	2009-12-07 15:00:00	By now he had also calmed down, and kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.
291	2009-12-08 09:00:00	
292	2009-12-08 09:30:00	"Did you understand a word of all that?" the chief clerk asked his parents, "surely he's not trying to make fools of us".
293	2009-12-08 10:00:00	"Oh, God!" called his mother, who was already in tears, "he could be seriously ill and we're making him suffer.
294	2009-12-08 10:30:00	Grete!
295	2009-12-08 11:00:00	Grete!" she then cried.
296	2009-12-08 11:30:00	"Mother?" his sister called from the other side.
297	2009-12-08 12:00:00	They communicated across Gregor's room.
298	2009-12-08 12:30:00	"You'll have to go for the doctor straight away.
299	2009-12-08 13:00:00	Gregor is ill.
300	2009-12-08 13:30:00	Quick, get the doctor.
301	2009-12-08 14:00:00	Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just now?" "That was the voice of an animal", said the chief clerk,
302	2009-12-08 14:30:00	with a calmness that was in contrast with his mother's screams.
303	2009-12-08 15:00:00	"Anna!
304	2009-12-08 15:30:00	Anna!" his father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping his hands, "get a locksmith here, now!" And the two girls,
305	2009-12-08 16:00:00	their skirts swishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as they went.
306	2009-12-08 16:30:00	How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly?
307	2009-12-08 17:00:00	There was no sound of the door banging shut again;
308	2009-12-08 17:30:00	they must have left it open;
309	2009-12-08 18:00:00	people often do in homes where something awful has happened.
310	2009-12-09 09:00:00	
311	2009-12-09 09:30:00	Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer.
312	2009-12-09 10:00:00	So they couldn't understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than before -
313	2009-12-09 10:30:00	perhaps his ears had become used to the sound.
314	2009-12-09 11:00:00	They had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and were ready to help.
315	2009-12-09 11:30:00	The first response to his situation had been confident and wise, and that made him feel better.
316	2009-12-09 12:00:00	He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising achievements -
317	2009-12-09 12:30:00	although he did not really distinguish one from the other.
318	2009-12-09 13:00:00	Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he coughed a little,
319	2009-12-09 13:30:00	but taking care to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure he could judge this for himself.
320	2009-12-09 14:00:00	Meanwhile, it had become very quiet in the next room.
321	2009-12-09 14:30:00	Perhaps his parents were sat at the table whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed against the door and listening.
322	2009-12-10 09:00:00	
323	2009-12-10 09:30:00	Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair.
324	2009-12-10 10:00:00	Once there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs.
325	2009-12-10 10:30:00	He rested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his mouth.
326	2009-12-10 11:00:00	He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth - how was he, then, to grasp the key?
327	2009-12-10 11:30:00	- but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw;
328	2009-12-10 12:00:00	using the jaw, he really was able to start the key turning,
329	2009-12-10 12:30:00	ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth,
330	2009-12-10 13:00:00	flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor.
331	2009-12-10 13:30:00	"Listen", said the chief clerk in the next room, "he's turning the key." Gregor was greatly encouraged by this;
332	2009-12-10 14:00:00	but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his mother too: "Well done, Gregor", they should have cried, "keep at it,
333	2009-12-10 14:30:00	keep hold of the lock!" And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength,
334	2009-12-10 15:00:00	paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself.
335	2009-12-10 15:30:00	As the key turned round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright with his mouth,
336	2009-12-10 16:00:00	and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the whole weight of his body as needed.
337	2009-12-10 16:30:00	The clear sound of the lock as it snapped back was Gregor's sign that he could break his concentration,
338	2009-12-10 17:00:00	and as he regained his breath he said to himself: "So, I didn't need the locksmith after all".
339	2009-12-10 17:30:00	Then he lay his head on the handle of the door to open it completely.
340	2009-12-11 09:00:00	
341	2009-12-11 09:30:00	Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open before he could be seen.
342	2009-12-11 10:00:00	He had first to slowly turn himself around one of the double doors,
343	2009-12-11 10:30:00	and he had to do it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the room.
344	2009-12-11 11:00:00	He was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud
345	2009-12-11 11:30:00	"Oh!", which sounded like the soughing of the wind.
346	2009-12-11 12:00:00	Now he also saw him - he was the nearest to the door -
347	2009-12-11 12:30:00	his hand pressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force.
348	2009-12-11 13:00:00	Gregor's mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk's being there, looked at his father.
349	2009-12-11 13:30:00	Then she unfolded her arms,
350	2009-12-11 14:00:00	took two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto her breast.
351	2009-12-11 14:30:00	His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room.
352	2009-12-11 15:00:00	Then he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.
353	2009-12-12 09:00:00	
354	2009-12-12 09:30:00	So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place.
355	2009-12-12 10:00:00	In this way only half of his body could be seen,
356	2009-12-12 10:30:00	along with his head above it which he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others.
357	2009-12-12 11:00:00	Meanwhile the day had become much lighter;
358	2009-12-12 11:30:00	part of the endless, grey-black building on the other side of the street - which was a hospital -
359	2009-12-12 12:00:00	could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its facade;
360	2009-12-12 12:30:00	the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the ground one at a time.
361	2009-12-12 13:00:00	The washing up from breakfast lay on the table;
362	2009-12-12 13:30:00	there was so much of it because, for Gregor's father,
363	2009-12-12 14:00:00	breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of different newspapers.
364	2009-12-12 14:30:00	On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army,
365	2009-12-12 15:00:00	his sword in his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing.
366	2009-12-12 15:30:00	The door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down below.
367	2009-12-13 09:00:00	
368	2009-12-13 09:30:00	"Now, then", said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have kept calm, "I'll get dressed straight away now,
369	2009-12-13 10:00:00	pack up my samples and set off.
370	2009-12-13 10:30:00	Will you please just let me leave?
371	2009-12-13 11:00:00	You can see", he said to the chief clerk, "that I'm not stubborn and like I like to do my job;
372	2009-12-13 11:30:00	being a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn't earn my living.
373	2009-12-13 12:00:00	So where are you going, in to the office?
374	2009-12-13 12:30:00	Yes?
375	2009-12-13 13:00:00	Will you report everything accurately, then?
376	2009-12-13 13:30:00	It's quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to work,
377	2009-12-13 14:00:00	but that's just the right time to remember what's been achieved in the past and consider that later on,
378	2009-12-13 14:30:00	once the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all the more diligence and concentration.
379	2009-12-13 15:00:00	You're well aware that I'm seriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my parents and my sister,
380	2009-12-13 15:30:00	so that I'm trapped in a difficult situation, but I will work my way out of it again.
381	2009-12-13 16:00:00	Please don't make things any harder for me than they are already, and don't take sides against me at the office.
382	2009-12-13 16:30:00	I know that nobody likes the travellers.
383	2009-12-13 17:00:00	They think we earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it.
384	2009-12-13 17:30:00	That's just prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better it.
385	2009-12-13 18:00:00	But you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in fact, if I can say this in confidence,
386	2009-12-13 18:30:00	a better overview than the boss himself -
387	2009-12-13 19:00:00	it's very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should.
388	2009-12-13 19:30:00	And you're also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year away from the office,
389	2009-12-13 20:00:00	so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints,
390	2009-12-13 20:30:00	and it's almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of thing, we don't usually even hear about them,
391	2009-12-13 21:00:00	or if at all it's when we arrive back home exhausted from a trip,
392	2009-12-13 21:30:00	and that's when we feel the harmful effects of what's been going on without even knowing what caused them.
393	2009-12-13 22:00:00	Please, don't go away, at least first say something to show that you grant that I'm at least partly right!"
394	2009-12-14 09:00:00	
395	2009-12-14 09:30:00	But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to speak, and, with protruding lips,
396	2009-12-14 10:00:00	only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders as he left.
397	2009-12-14 10:30:00	He did not keep still for a moment while Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without taking his eyes off him.
398	2009-12-14 11:00:00	He moved very gradually, as if there had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room.
399	2009-12-14 11:30:00	It was only when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his foot from the living room,
400	2009-12-14 12:00:00	and rushed forward in a panic.
401	2009-12-14 12:30:00	In the hall, he stretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there,
402	2009-12-14 13:00:00	there were some supernatural force waiting to save him.
403	2009-12-15 09:00:00	
404	2009-12-15 09:30:00	Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger.
405	2009-12-15 10:00:00	That was something his parents did not understand very well;
406	2009-12-15 10:30:00	over the years, they had become convinced that this job would provide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides,
407	2009-12-15 11:00:00	they had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for the future.
408	2009-12-15 11:30:00	Gregor, though, did think about the future.
409	2009-12-15 12:00:00	The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over;
410	2009-12-15 12:30:00	the future of Gregor and his family depended on it!
411	2009-12-15 13:00:00	If only his sister were here!
412	2009-12-15 13:30:00	She was clever;
413	2009-12-15 14:00:00	she was already in tears while Gregor was still lying peacefully on his back.
414	2009-12-15 14:30:00	And the chief clerk was a lover of women, surely she could persuade him;
415	2009-12-15 15:00:00	she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state.
416	2009-12-15 15:30:00	But his sister was not there, Gregor would have to do the job himself.
417	2009-12-15 16:00:00	And without considering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move about in his present state,
418	2009-12-15 16:30:00	or that his speech still might not - or probably would not - be understood, he let go of the door;
419	2009-12-15 17:00:00	pushed himself through the opening;
420	2009-12-15 17:30:00	tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who, ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands;
421	2009-12-15 18:00:00	but Gregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought something to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs.
422	2009-12-15 18:30:00	Hardly had that happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel alright with his body;
423	2009-12-15 19:00:00	the little legs had the solid ground under them;
424	2009-12-15 19:30:00	to his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them;
425	2009-12-15 20:00:00	they were even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go;
426	2009-12-15 20:30:00	and he was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end.
427	2009-12-15 21:00:00	He held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there on the floor.
428	2009-12-15 21:30:00	His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself,
429	2009-12-15 22:00:00	but then she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: "Help, for pity's sake, Help!"
430	2009-12-15 22:30:00	The way she held her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better,
431	2009-12-15 23:00:00	but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not;
432	2009-12-15 23:30:00	she had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the breakfast things on it;
433	2009-12-16 00:00:00	when she reached the table she sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing;
434	2009-12-16 00:30:00	without even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.
435	2009-12-17 09:00:00	
436	2009-12-17 09:30:00	"Mother, mother", said Gregor gently, looking up at her.
437	2009-12-17 10:00:00	He had completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment,
438	2009-12-17 10:30:00	but could not help himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of coffee.
439	2009-12-17 11:00:00	That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her.
440	2009-12-17 11:30:00	Gregor, though, had no time to spare for his parents now;
441	2009-12-17 12:00:00	the chief clerk had already reached the stairs;
442	2009-12-17 12:30:00	with his chin on the banister, he looked back for the last time.
443	2009-12-17 13:00:00	Gregor made a run for him;
444	2009-12-17 13:30:00	he wanted to be sure of reaching him;
445	2009-12-17 14:00:00	the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt down several steps at once and disappeared;
446	2009-12-17 14:30:00	his shouts resounding all around the staircase.
447	2009-12-17 15:00:00	The flight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put Gregor's father into a panic as well.
448	2009-12-17 15:30:00	Until then he had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running after the chief clerk himself,
449	2009-12-17 16:00:00	or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him,
450	2009-12-17 16:30:00	Gregor's father seized the chief clerk's stick in his right hand (the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair,
451	2009-12-17 17:00:00	along with his hat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with his left,
452	2009-12-17 17:30:00	and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping his foot at him as he went.
453	2009-12-17 18:00:00	Gregor's appeals to his father were of no help, his appeals were simply not understood,
454	2009-12-17 18:30:00	however much he humbly turned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.
455	2009-12-17 19:00:00	Across the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor's mother had pulled open a window,
456	2009-12-17 19:30:00	leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face.
457	2009-12-17 20:00:00	A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the curtains flew up,
458	2009-12-17 20:30:00	the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor.
459	2009-12-17 21:00:00	Nothing would stop Gregor's father as he drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man.
460	2009-12-17 21:30:00	Gregor had never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go very slowly.
461	2009-12-17 22:00:00	If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would have been back in his room straight away,
462	2009-12-17 22:30:00	but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that his father would become impatient,
463	2009-12-17 23:00:00	and there was the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father's hand any moment.
464	2009-12-17 23:30:00	Eventually, though, Gregor realised that he had no choice as he saw, to his disgust,
465	2009-12-18 00:00:00	that he was quite incapable of going backwards in a straight line;
466	2009-12-18 00:30:00	so he began, as quickly as possible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn himself round.
467	2009-12-18 01:00:00	It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him,
468	2009-12-18 01:30:00	in fact now and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a distance as to which way to turn.
469	2009-12-18 02:00:00	If only his father would stop that unbearable hissing!
470	2009-12-18 02:30:00	It was making Gregor quite confused.
471	2009-12-18 03:00:00	When he had nearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing,
472	2009-12-18 03:30:00	he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come.
473	2009-12-18 04:00:00	He was pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow,
474	2009-12-18 04:30:00	and his body was too broad to get through it without further difficulty.
475	2009-12-18 05:00:00	In his present mood,
476	2009-12-18 05:30:00	it obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double doors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through.
477	2009-12-18 06:00:00	He was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room as quickly as possible.
478	2009-12-18 06:30:00	Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway.
479	2009-12-18 07:00:00	What he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way;
480	2009-12-18 07:30:00	it sounded to Gregor as if there was now more than one father behind him;
481	2009-12-18 08:00:00	it was not a pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without regard for what might happen.
482	2009-12-18 08:30:00	One side of his body lifted itself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured,
483	2009-12-18 09:00:00	leaving vile brown flecks on it, soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by himself,
484	2009-12-18 09:30:00	the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground.
485	2009-12-18 10:00:00	Then his father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from where he was held and sent him flying, and heavily bleeding,
486	2009-12-18 10:30:00	deep into his room.
487	2009-12-18 11:00:00	The door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all was quiet.
488	2009-12-19 09:00:00	
489	2009-12-19 09:30:00	== II ==
490	2009-12-19 10:00:00	It was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke from his deep and coma-like sleep.
491	2009-12-19 10:30:00	He would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if he hadn't been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and felt fully rested.
492	2009-12-19 11:00:00	But he had the impression that some hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully shut had woken him.
493	2009-12-19 11:30:00	The light from the electric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but down below,
494	2009-12-19 12:00:00	where Gregor was, it was dark.
495	2009-12-19 12:30:00	He pushed himself over to the door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae - of which he was now beginning to learn the value -
496	2009-12-19 13:00:00	in order to see what had been happening there.
497	2009-12-19 13:30:00	The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs.
498	2009-12-19 14:00:00	One of the legs had been badly injured in the events of that morning - it was nearly a miracle that only one of them had been -
499	2009-12-19 14:30:00	and dragged along lifelessly.
500	2009-12-20 09:00:00	
501	2009-12-20 09:30:00	It was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it actually was that had drawn him over to it;
502	2009-12-20 10:00:00	it was the smell of something to eat.
503	2009-12-20 10:30:00	By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it.
504	2009-12-20 11:00:00	He was so pleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he had been that morning, and immediately dipped his head into the milk,
505	2009-12-20 11:30:00	nearly covering his eyes with it.
506	2009-12-20 12:00:00	But he soon drew his head back again in disappointment;
507	2009-12-20 12:30:00	not only did the pain in his tender left side make it difficult to eat the food -
508	2009-12-20 13:00:00	he was only able to eat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole - but the milk did not taste at all nice.
509	2009-12-20 13:30:00	Milk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister had certainly left it there for him because of that, but he turned,
510	2009-12-20 14:00:00	almost against his own will, away from the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room.
511	2009-12-21 09:00:00	
512	2009-12-21 09:30:00	Through the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been lit in the living room.
513	2009-12-21 10:00:00	His father at this time would normally be sat with his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor's mother,
514	2009-12-21 10:30:00	and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not a sound to be heard.
515	2009-12-21 11:00:00	Gregor's sister would often write and tell him about this reading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times.
516	2009-12-21 11:30:00	It was so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody in the flat.
517	2009-12-21 12:00:00	"What a quiet life it is the family lead", said Gregor to himself, and, gazing into the darkness,
518	2009-12-21 12:30:00	felt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and parents.
519	2009-12-21 13:00:00	But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and frightening end?
520	2009-12-21 13:30:00	That was something that Gregor did not want to think about too much, so he started to move about, crawling up and down the room.
521	2009-12-22 09:00:00	
522	2009-12-22 09:30:00	Once during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was opened very slightly and hurriedly closed again;
523	2009-12-22 10:00:00	later on the door on the other side did the same;
524	2009-12-22 10:30:00	it seemed that someone needed to enter the room but thought better of it.
525	2009-12-22 11:00:00	Gregor went and waited immediately by the door,
526	2009-12-22 11:30:00	resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it was;
527	2009-12-22 12:00:00	but the door was opened no more that night and Gregor waited in vain.
528	2009-12-22 12:30:00	The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him, but now,
529	2009-12-22 13:00:00	now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came,
530	2009-12-22 13:30:00	and the keys were in the other sides.
531	2009-12-23 09:00:00	
532	2009-12-23 09:30:00	It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was put out,
533	2009-12-23 10:00:00	and now it was easy to see that parents and sister had stayed awake all that time,
534	2009-12-23 10:30:00	as they all could be distinctly heard as they went away together on tip-toe.
535	2009-12-23 11:00:00	It was clear that no-one would come into Gregor's room any more until morning;
536	2009-12-23 11:30:00	that gave him plenty of time to think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life.
537	2009-12-23 12:00:00	For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor,
538	2009-12-23 12:30:00	even though he had been living in it for five years.
539	2009-12-23 13:00:00	Hardly aware of what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch.
540	2009-12-23 13:30:00	It pressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lift his head,
541	2009-12-23 14:00:00	but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only regret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.
542	2009-12-24 09:00:00	
543	2009-12-24 09:30:00	He spent the whole night there.
544	2009-12-24 10:00:00	Some of the time he passed in a light sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his hunger,
545	2009-12-24 10:30:00	and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes which, however,
546	2009-12-24 11:00:00	always led to the same conclusion: for the time being he must remain calm,
547	2009-12-24 11:30:00	he must show patience and the greatest consideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he, in his present condition,
548	2009-12-24 12:00:00	was forced to impose on them.
549	2009-12-25 09:00:00	
550	2009-12-25 09:30:00	Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions, as early the next morning, almost before the night had ended,
551	2009-12-25 10:00:00	his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in.
552	2009-12-25 10:30:00	She did not see him straight away, but when she did notice him under the couch - he had to be somewhere, for God's sake,
553	2009-12-25 11:00:00	he couldn't have flown away - she was so shocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shut again from outside.
554	2009-12-25 11:30:00	But she seemed to regret her behaviour,
555	2009-12-25 12:00:00	as she opened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger.
556	2009-12-25 12:30:00	Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the edge of the couch, and watched her.
557	2009-12-25 13:00:00	Would she notice that he had left the milk as it was,
558	2009-12-25 13:30:00	realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring him in some other food that was more suitable?
559	2009-12-25 14:00:00	If she didn't do it herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it,
560	2009-12-25 14:30:00	although he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the couch,
561	2009-12-25 15:00:00	throw himself at his sister's feet and beg her for something good to eat.
562	2009-12-25 15:30:00	However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some surprise.
563	2009-12-25 16:00:00	She immediately picked it up - using a rag, not her bare hands - and carried it out.
564	2009-12-25 16:30:00	Gregor was extremely curious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities,
565	2009-12-25 17:00:00	but he never could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did bring.
566	2009-12-25 17:30:00	In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of things, all spread out on an old newspaper.
567	2009-12-25 18:00:00	There were old, half-rotten vegetables;
568	2009-12-25 18:30:00	bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard;
569	2009-12-25 19:00:00	a few raisins and almonds;
570	2009-12-25 19:30:00	some cheese that Gregor had declared inedible two days before;
571	2009-12-25 20:00:00	a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt.
572	2009-12-25 20:30:00	As well as all that she had poured some water into the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor's use,
573	2009-12-25 21:00:00	and placed it beside them.
574	2009-12-25 21:30:00	Then, out of consideration for Gregor's feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her,
575	2009-12-25 22:00:00	she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he liked.
576	2009-12-25 22:30:00	Gregor's little legs whirred, at last he could eat.
577	2009-12-25 23:00:00	What's more, his injuries must already have completely healed as he found no difficulty in moving.
578	2009-12-25 23:30:00	This amazed him, as more than a month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife,
579	2009-12-26 00:00:00	he thought of how his finger had still hurt the day before yesterday.
580	2009-12-26 00:30:00	"Am I less sensitive than I used to be, then?", he thought, and was already sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately,
581	2009-12-26 01:00:00	almost compellingly, attracted him much more than the other foods on the newspaper.
582	2009-12-26 01:30:00	Quickly one after another, his eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce;
583	2009-12-26 02:00:00	the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn't like at all,
584	2009-12-26 02:30:00	and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them because he couldn't stand the smell.
585	2009-12-26 03:00:00	Long after he had finished eating and lay lethargic in the same place,
586	2009-12-26 03:30:00	his sister slowly turned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw.
587	2009-12-26 04:00:00	He was immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he hurried back under the couch.
588	2009-12-26 04:30:00	But he needed great self-control to stay there even for the short time that his sister was in the room,
589	2009-12-26 05:00:00	as eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could hardly breathe in that narrow space.
590	2009-12-26 05:30:00	Half suffocating, he watched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up the left-overs,
591	2009-12-26 06:00:00	mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more.
592	2009-12-26 06:30:00	She quickly dropped it all into a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out.
593	2009-12-26 07:00:00	She had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under the couch and stretched himself.
594	2009-12-27 09:00:00	
595	2009-12-27 09:30:00	This was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the morning while his parents and the maid were still asleep,
596	2009-12-27 10:00:00	and the second time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would sleep for a little while then as well,
597	2009-12-27 10:30:00	and Gregor's sister would send the maid away on some errand.
598	2009-12-27 11:00:00	Gregor's father and mother certainly did not want him to starve either,
599	2009-12-27 11:30:00	but perhaps it would have been more than they could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being told about it,
600	2009-12-27 12:00:00	and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they were indeed suffering enough.
601	2009-12-28 09:00:00	
602	2009-12-28 09:30:00	It was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat.
603	2009-12-28 10:00:00	As nobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that he could understand them,
604	2009-12-28 10:30:00	so he had to be content to hear his sister's sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room.
605	2009-12-28 11:00:00	It was only later, when she had become a little more used to everything - there was, of course,
606	2009-12-28 11:30:00	no question of her ever becoming fully used to the situation - that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment,
607	2009-12-28 12:00:00	or at least a comment that could be construed as friendly.
608	2009-12-28 12:30:00	"He's enjoyed his dinner today", she might say when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him, or if he left most of it,
609	2009-12-28 13:00:00	which slowly became more and more frequent, she would often say, sadly, "now everything's just been left there again".
610	2009-12-29 09:00:00	
611	2009-12-29 09:30:00	Although Gregor wasn't able to hear any news directly he did listen to much of what was said in the next rooms,
612	2009-12-29 10:00:00	and whenever he heard anyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and press his whole body against it.
613	2009-12-29 10:30:00	There was seldom any conversation, especially at first, that was not about him in some way, even if only in secret.
614	2009-12-29 11:00:00	For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime was about what they should do now;
615	2009-12-29 11:30:00	but even between meals they spoke about the same subject as there were always at least two members of the family at home -
616	2009-12-29 12:00:00	nobody wanted to be at home by themselves and it was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty.
617	2009-12-29 12:30:00	And on the very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and begged Gregor's mother to let her go without delay.
618	2009-12-29 13:00:00	It was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter of an hour,
619	2009-12-29 13:30:00	tearfully thanking Gregor's mother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service.
620	2009-12-29 14:00:00	She even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had happened, even though no-one had asked that of her.
621	2009-12-30 09:00:00	
622	2009-12-30 09:30:00	Now Gregor's sister also had to help his mother with the cooking;
623	2009-12-30 10:00:00	although that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much.
624	2009-12-30 10:30:00	Gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another to eat, and receive no more answer than "no thanks,
625	2009-12-30 11:00:00	I've had enough" or something similar.
626	2009-12-30 11:30:00	No-one drank very much either.
627	2009-12-30 12:00:00	His sister would sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping for the chance to go and fetch it herself.
628	2009-12-30 12:30:00	When his father then said nothing she would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that she could send the housekeeper for it,
629	2009-12-30 13:00:00	but then his father would close the matter with a big, loud "No", and no more would be said.
630	2009-12-31 09:00:00	
631	2009-12-31 09:30:00	Even before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained to Gregor's mother and sister what their finances and prospects were.
632	2009-12-31 10:00:00	Now and then he stood up from the table and took some receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved from his business when it had collapsed five years earlier.
633	2009-12-31 10:30:00	Gregor heard how he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he had taken the item he wanted.
634	2009-12-31 11:00:00	What he heard his father say was some of the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first been incarcerated in his room.
635	2009-12-31 11:30:00	He had thought that nothing at all remained from his father's business, at least he had never told him anything different,
636	2009-12-31 12:00:00	and Gregor had never asked him about it anyway.
637	2009-12-31 12:30:00	Their business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total despair,
638	2009-12-31 13:00:00	and Gregor's only concern at that time had been to arrange things so that they could all forget about it as quickly as possible.
639	2009-12-31 13:30:00	So then he started working especially hard,
640	2009-12-31 14:00:00	with a fiery vigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling representative almost overnight,
641	2009-12-31 14:30:00	bringing with it the chance to earn money in quite different ways.
642	2009-12-31 15:00:00	Gregor converted his success at work straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the benefit of his astonished and delighted family.
643	2009-12-31 15:30:00	They had been good times and they had never come again, at least not with the same splendour,
644	2009-12-31 16:00:00	even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was in a position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear them.
645	2009-12-31 16:30:00	They had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it,
646	2009-12-31 17:00:00	although there was no longer much warm affection given in return.
647	2009-12-31 17:30:00	Gregor only remained close to his sister now.
648	2009-12-31 18:00:00	Unlike him, she was very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist,
649	2009-12-31 18:30:00	it was his secret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though it would cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some other way.
650	2009-12-31 19:00:00	During Gregor's short periods in town,
651	2009-12-31 19:30:00	conversation with his sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever mentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised.
652	2009-12-31 20:00:00	Their parents did not like to hear this innocent talk,
653	2009-12-31 20:30:00	but Gregor thought about it quite hard and decided he would let them know what he planned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day.
654	2010-01-01 09:00:00	
655	2010-01-01 09:30:00	That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his mind in his present state,
656	2010-01-01 10:00:00	pressed upright against the door and listening.
657	2010-01-01 10:30:00	There were times when he simply became too tired to continue listening,
658	2010-01-01 11:00:00	when his head would fall wearily against the door and he would pull it up again with a start,
659	2010-01-01 11:30:00	as even the slightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would all go silent.
660	2010-01-01 12:00:00	"What's that he's doing now", his father would say after a while, clearly having gone over to the door,
661	2010-01-01 12:30:00	and only then would the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again.
662	2010-01-02 09:00:00	
663	2010-01-02 09:30:00	When explaining things, his father repeated himself several times,
664	2010-01-02 10:00:00	partly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these matters himself and partly because Gregor's mother did not understand everything first time.
665	2010-01-02 10:30:00	From these repeated explanations Gregor learned, to his pleasure,
666	2010-01-02 11:00:00	that despite all their misfortunes there was still some money available from the old days.
667	2010-01-02 11:30:00	It was not a lot, but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest had accumulated.
668	2010-01-02 12:00:00	Besides that, they had not been using up all the money that Gregor had been bringing home every month, keeping only a little for himself,
669	2010-01-02 12:30:00	so that that, too, had been accumulating.
670	2010-01-02 13:00:00	Behind the door, Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at this unexpected thrift and caution.
671	2010-01-02 13:30:00	He could actually have used this surplus money to reduce his father's debt to his boss,
672	2010-01-02 14:00:00	and the day when he could have freed himself from that job would have come much closer,
673	2010-01-02 14:30:00	but now it was certainly better the way his father had done things.
674	2010-01-03 09:00:00	
675	2010-01-03 09:30:00	This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to live off the interest;
676	2010-01-03 10:00:00	it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one or two years, no more.
677	2010-01-03 10:30:00	That's to say, it was money that should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies;
678	2010-01-03 11:00:00	money to live on had to be earned.
679	2010-01-03 11:30:00	His father was healthy but old, and lacking in self confidence.
680	2010-01-03 12:00:00	During the five years that he had not been working - the first holiday in a life that had been full of strain and no success -
681	2010-01-03 12:30:00	he had put on a lot of weight and become very slow and clumsy.
682	2010-01-03 13:00:00	Would Gregor's elderly mother now have to go and earn money?
683	2010-01-03 13:30:00	She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her just to move about the home,
684	2010-01-03 14:00:00	every other day would be spent struggling for breath on the sofa by the open window.
685	2010-01-03 14:30:00	Would his sister have to go and earn money?
686	2010-01-03 15:00:00	She was still a child of seventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable, consisting of wearing nice clothes, sleeping late,
687	2010-01-03 15:30:00	helping out in the business, joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the violin.
688	2010-01-03 16:00:00	Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money, Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himself onto the cool,
689	2010-01-03 16:30:00	leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot with shame and regret.
690	2010-01-04 09:00:00	
691	2010-01-04 09:30:00	He would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink but scratching at the leather for hours on end.
692	2010-01-04 10:00:00	Or he might go to all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the sill and, propped up in the chair,
693	2010-01-04 10:30:00	leaning on the window to stare out of it.
694	2010-01-04 11:00:00	He had used to feel a great sense of freedom from doing this, but doing it now was obviously something more remembered than experienced,
695	2010-01-04 11:30:00	as what he actually saw in this way was becoming less distinct every day, even things that were quite near;
696	2010-01-04 12:00:00	he had used to curse the ever-present view of the hospital across the street, but now he could not see it at all,
697	2010-01-04 12:30:00	and if he had not known that he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which was a quiet street despite being in the middle of the city,
698	2010-01-04 13:00:00	he could have thought that he was looking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the grey earth mingled inseparably.
699	2010-01-04 13:30:00	His observant sister only needed to notice the chair twice before she would always push
700	2010-01-04 13:30:00	it back to its exact position by the window after she had tidied up the room,
701	2010-01-04 14:00:00	and even left the inner pane of the window open from then on.
702	2010-01-05 09:00:00	
703	2010-01-05 09:30:00	If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him to bear it;
704	2010-01-05 10:00:00	but as it was it caused him pain.
705	2010-01-05 10:30:00	His sister, naturally, tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing burdensome about it, and the longer it went on, of course,
706	2010-01-05 11:00:00	the better she was able to do so, but as time went by Gregor was also able to see through it all so much better.
707	2010-01-05 11:30:00	It had even become very unpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered the room.
708	2010-01-05 12:00:00	No sooner had she come in than she would quickly close the door as
709	2010-01-05 12:00:00	a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into Gregor's room,
710	2010-01-05 12:30:00	then she would go straight to the window and pull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating.
711	2010-01-05 13:00:00	Even if it was cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while.
712	2010-01-05 13:30:00	She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about and noise making;
713	2010-01-05 14:00:00	he would stay under the couch shivering the whole while, knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to spare him this ordeal,
714	2010-01-05 14:30:00	but it was impossible for her to be in the same room with him with the windows closed.
715	2010-01-06 09:00:00	
716	2010-01-06 09:30:00	One day, about a month after Gregor's transformation when his sister no longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance,
717	2010-01-06 10:00:00	she came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still staring out the window, motionless,
718	2010-01-06 10:30:00	and just where he would be most horrible.
719	2010-01-06 11:00:00	In itself,
720	2010-01-06 11:30:00	his sister's not coming into the room would have been no surprise for Gregor as it
721	2010-01-06 11:30:00	would have been difficult for her to immediately open the window while he was still there,
722	2010-01-06 12:00:00	but not only did she not come in, she went straight back and closed the door behind her,
723	2010-01-06 12:30:00	a stranger would have thought he had threatened her and tried to bite her.
724	2010-01-06 13:00:00	Gregor went straight to hide himself under the couch, of course,
725	2010-01-06 13:30:00	but he had to wait until midday before his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy than usual.
726	2010-01-06 14:00:00	It made him realise that she still found his appearance unbearable and would continue to do so,
727	2010-01-06 14:30:00	she probably even had to overcome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that protruded from under the couch.
728	2010-01-06 15:00:00	One day, in order to spare her even this sight,
729	2010-01-06 15:30:00	he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered and his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down.
730	2010-01-06 16:00:00	If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do was take it off again,
731	2010-01-06 16:30:00	as it was clear enough that it was no pleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely.
732	2010-01-06 17:00:00	She left the sheet where it was.
733	2010-01-06 17:30:00	Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of gratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet to see how his sister liked the new arrangement.
734	2010-01-07 09:00:00	
735	2010-01-07 09:30:00	For the first fourteen days, Gregor's parents could not bring themselves to come into the room to see him.
736	2010-01-07 10:00:00	He would often hear them say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing even though, before,
737	2010-01-07 10:30:00	they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat useless and frequently been annoyed with her.
738	2010-01-07 11:00:00	But now the two of them, father and mother, would often both wait outside the door of Gregor's room while his sister tidied up in there,
739	2010-01-07 11:30:00	and as soon as she went out again she would have to tell them exactly how everything looked, what Gregor had eaten,
740	2010-01-07 12:00:00	how he had behaved this time and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen.
741	2010-01-07 12:30:00	His mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor relatively soon but his father and sister at first persuaded her against it.
742	2010-01-07 13:00:00	Gregor listened very closely to all this, and approved fully.
743	2010-01-07 13:30:00	Later, though, she had to be held back by force, which made her call out: "Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son!
744	2010-01-07 14:00:00	Can't you understand I have to see him?", and Gregor would think to himself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in,
745	2010-01-07 14:30:00	not every day of course, but one day a week, perhaps;
746	2010-01-07 15:00:00	she could understand everything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was still just a child after all,
747	2010-01-07 15:30:00	and really might not have had an adult's appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.
748	2010-01-08 09:00:00	
749	2010-01-08 09:30:00	Gregor's wish to see his mother was soon realised.
750	2010-01-08 10:00:00	Out of consideration for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day,
751	2010-01-08 10:30:00	the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room to crawl about, it was hard to just lie quietly through the night,
752	2010-01-08 11:00:00	his food soon stopped giving him any pleasure at all, and so, to entertain himself,
753	2010-01-08 11:30:00	he got into the habit of crawling up and down the walls and ceiling.
754	2010-01-08 12:00:00	He was especially fond of hanging from the ceiling;
755	2010-01-08 12:30:00	it was quite different from lying on the floor;
756	2010-01-08 13:00:00	he could breathe more freely;
757	2010-01-08 13:30:00	his body had a light swing to it;
758	2010-01-08 14:00:00	and up there, relaxed and almost happy,
759	2010-01-08 14:30:00	it might happen that he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling and landing on the floor with a crash.
760	2010-01-08 15:00:00	But now, of course, he had far better control of his body than before and, even with a fall as great as that, caused himself no damage.
761	2010-01-08 15:30:00	Very soon his sister noticed Gregor's new way of entertaining himself - he had, after all,
762	2010-01-08 16:00:00	left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about -
763	2010-01-08 16:30:00	and got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by removing the furniture that got in his way,
764	2010-01-08 17:00:00	especially the chest of drawers and the desk.
765	2010-01-08 17:30:00	Now, this was not something that she would be able to do by herself;
766	2010-01-08 18:00:00	she did not dare to ask for help from her father;
767	2010-01-08 18:30:00	the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the cook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this,
768	2010-01-08 19:00:00	she had even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times and never to have to open the door unless it was especially important;
769	2010-01-08 19:30:00	so his sister had no choice but to choose some time when Gregor's father was not there and fetch his mother to help her.
770	2010-01-08 20:00:00	As she approached the room, Gregor could hear his mother express her joy, but once at the door she went silent.
771	2010-01-08 20:30:00	First, of course, his sister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room was alright;
772	2010-01-08 21:00:00	and only then did she let her mother enter.
773	2010-01-08 21:30:00	Gregor had hurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more folds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just been thrown down by chance.
774	2010-01-08 22:00:00	Gregor also refrained, this time, from spying out from under the sheet;
775	2010-01-08 22:30:00	he gave up the chance to see his mother until later and was simply glad that she had come.
776	2010-01-08 23:00:00	"You can come in, he can't be seen", said his sister, obviously leading her in by the hand.
777	2010-01-08 23:30:00	The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair of feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they pushed it from its place,
778	2010-01-09 00:00:00	his sister always taking on the heaviest part of the work for herself and ignoring her mother's warnings that she would strain herself.
779	2010-01-09 00:30:00	This lasted a very long time.
780	2010-01-09 01:00:00	After labouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would be better to leave the chest where it was,
781	2010-01-09 01:30:00	for one thing it was too heavy for them to get the job finished before Gregor's father got
782	2010-01-09 01:30:00	home and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his way even more,
783	2010-01-09 02:00:00	and for another thing it wasn't even sure that taking the furniture away would really be any help to him.
784	2010-01-09 02:30:00	She thought just the opposite;
785	2010-01-09 03:00:00	the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her heart;
786	2010-01-09 03:30:00	and why wouldn't Gregor feel the same way about it,
787	2010-01-09 04:00:00	he'd been used to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make him feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that.
788	2010-01-09 04:30:00	Then, quietly, almost whispering as if wanting Gregor (whose whereabouts she did not know) to hear not even the tone of her voice,
789	2010-01-09 05:00:00	as she was convinced that he did not understand her words, she added "and by taking the furniture away,
790	2010-01-09 05:30:00	won't it seem like we're showing that we've given up all hope of improvement and we're abandoning him to cope for himself?
791	2010-01-09 06:00:00	I think it'd be best to leave the room exactly the way it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again he'll find everything unchanged and he'll be able to forget the time in between all the easier".
792	2010-01-10 09:00:00	
793	2010-01-10 09:30:00	Hearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the lack of any direct human communication,
794	2010-01-10 10:00:00	along with the monotonous life led by the family during these two months, must have made him confused -
795	2010-01-10 10:30:00	he could think of no other way of explaining to himself why he had seriously wanted his room emptied out.
796	2010-01-10 11:00:00	Had he really wanted to transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out with the nice furniture he had inherited?
797	2010-01-10 11:30:00	That would have let him crawl around unimpeded in any direction,
798	2010-01-10 12:00:00	but it would also have let him quickly forget his past when he had still been human.
799	2010-01-10 12:30:00	He had come very close to forgetting, and it had only been the voice of his mother, unheard for so long, that had shaken him out of it.
800	2010-01-10 13:00:00	Nothing should be removed;
801	2010-01-10 13:30:00	everything had to stay;
802	2010-01-10 14:00:00	he could not do without the good influence the furniture had on his condition;
803	2010-01-10 14:30:00	and if the furniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that was not a loss but a great advantage.
804	2010-01-11 09:00:00	
805	2010-01-11 09:30:00	His sister, unfortunately, did not agree;
806	2010-01-11 10:00:00	she had become used to the idea, not without reason, that she was Gregor's spokesman to his parents about the things that concerned him.
807	2010-01-11 10:30:00	This meant that his mother's advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on removing not only the chest of drawers and the desk,
808	2010-01-11 11:00:00	as she had thought at first, but all the furniture apart from the all-important couch.
809	2010-01-11 11:30:00	It was more than childish perversity, of course, or the unexpected confidence she had recently acquired, that made her insist;
810	2010-01-11 12:00:00	she had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to crawl about in, whereas the furniture, as far as anyone could see,
811	2010-01-11 12:30:00	was of no use to him at all.
812	2010-01-11 13:00:00	Girls of that age, though, do become enthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way whenever they can.
813	2010-01-11 13:30:00	Perhaps this was what tempted Grete to make Gregor's situation seem even more shocking than it was so that she could do even more for him.
814	2010-01-11 14:00:00	Grete would probably be the only one who would dare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling about the bare walls by himself.
815	2010-01-12 09:00:00	
816	2010-01-12 09:30:00	So she refused to let her mother dissuade her.
817	2010-01-12 10:00:00	Gregor's mother already looked uneasy in his room,
818	2010-01-12 10:30:00	she soon stopped speaking and helped Gregor's sister to get the chest of drawers out with what strength she had.
819	2010-01-12 11:00:00	The chest of drawers was something that Gregor could do without if he had to, but the writing desk had to stay.
820	2010-01-12 11:30:00	Hardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers, groaning,
821	2010-01-12 12:00:00	out of the room than Gregor poked his head out from under the couch to see what he could do about it.
822	2010-01-12 12:30:00	He meant to be as careful and considerate as he could, but, unfortunately,
823	2010-01-12 13:00:00	it was his mother who came back first while Grete in the next room had her arms round the chest,
824	2010-01-12 13:30:00	pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herself without, of course, moving it an inch.
825	2010-01-12 14:00:00	His mother was not used to the sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill, so Gregor hurried backwards to the far end of the couch.
826	2010-01-12 14:30:00	In his startlement, though, he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a little.
827	2010-01-12 15:00:00	It was enough to attract his mother's attention.
828	2010-01-12 15:30:00	She stood very still, remained there a moment, and then went back out to Grete.
829	2010-01-13 09:00:00	
830	2010-01-13 09:30:00	Gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was happening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after all,
831	2010-01-13 10:00:00	but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their little calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the floor,
832	2010-01-13 10:30:00	all these things made him feel as if he were being assailed from all sides.
833	2010-01-13 11:00:00	With his head and legs pulled in against him and his body pressed to the floor,
834	2010-01-13 11:30:00	he was forced to admit to himself that he could not stand all of this much longer.
835	2010-01-13 12:00:00	They were emptying his room out;
836	2010-01-13 12:30:00	taking away everything that was dear to him;
837	2010-01-13 13:00:00	they had already taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other tools;
838	2010-01-13 13:30:00	now they threatened to remove the writing desk with its place clearly worn into the floor,
839	2010-01-13 14:00:00	the desk where he had done his homework as a business trainee, at high school, even while he had been at infant school -
840	2010-01-13 14:30:00	he really could not wait any longer to see whether the two women's intentions were good.
841	2010-01-13 15:00:00	He had nearly forgotten they were there anyway,
842	2010-01-13 15:30:00	as they were now too tired to say anything while they worked and he could only hear their feet as they stepped heavily on the floor.
843	2010-01-14 09:00:00	
844	2010-01-14 09:30:00	So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room catching their breath, he sallied out,
845	2010-01-14 10:00:00	changed direction four times not knowing what he should save first before his attention was suddenly caught by the picture on the wall -
846	2010-01-14 10:30:00	which was already denuded of everything else that had been on it - of the lady dressed in copious fur.
847	2010-01-14 11:00:00	He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself against its glass, it held him firmly and felt good on his hot belly.
848	2010-01-14 11:30:00	This picture at least, now totally covered by Gregor, would certainly be taken away by no-one.
849	2010-01-14 12:00:00	He turned his head to face the door into the living room so that he could watch the women when they came back.
850	2010-01-15 09:00:00	
851	2010-01-15 09:30:00	They had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite soon;
852	2010-01-15 10:00:00	Grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly carrying her.
853	2010-01-15 10:30:00	"What shall we take now, then?", said Grete and looked around.
854	2010-01-15 11:00:00	Her eyes met those of Gregor on the wall.
855	2010-01-15 11:30:00	Perhaps only because her mother was there, she remained calm, bent her face to her so that she would not look round and said,
856	2010-01-15 12:00:00	albeit hurriedly and with a tremor in her voice: "Come on, let's go back in the living room for a while?"
857	2010-01-15 12:30:00	Gregor could see what Grete had in mind, she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down from the wall.
858	2010-01-15 13:00:00	Well, she could certainly try it!
859	2010-01-15 13:30:00	He sat unyielding on his picture.
860	2010-01-15 14:00:00	He would rather jump at Grete's face.
861	2010-01-16 09:00:00	
862	2010-01-16 09:30:00	But Grete's words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to one side,
863	2010-01-16 10:00:00	saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw screamed:
864	2010-01-16 10:30:00	"Oh God, oh God!" Arms outstretched, she fell onto the couch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile.
865	2010-01-16 11:00:00	"Gregor!" shouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist.
866	2010-01-16 11:30:00	That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since his transformation.
867	2010-01-16 12:00:00	She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint;
868	2010-01-16 12:30:00	Gregor wanted to help too - he could save his picture later, although he stuck fast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force;
869	2010-01-16 13:00:00	then he, too, ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in the old days;
870	2010-01-16 13:30:00	but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing;
871	2010-01-16 14:00:00	she was looking into various bottles, he startled her when she turned round;
872	2010-01-16 14:30:00	a bottle fell to the ground and broke;
873	2010-01-16 15:00:00	a splinter cut Gregor's face, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him;
874	2010-01-16 15:30:00	now, without delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the bottles she could and ran with them in to her mother;
875	2010-01-16 16:00:00	she slammed the door shut with her foot.
876	2010-01-16 16:30:00	So now Gregor was shut out from his mother, who, because of him, might be near to death;
877	2010-01-16 17:00:00	he could not open the door if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she had to stay with his mother;
878	2010-01-16 17:30:00	there was nothing for him to do but wait;
879	2010-01-16 18:00:00	and, oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about, he crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling,
880	2010-01-16 18:30:00	and finally in his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell down into the middle of the dinner table.
881	2010-01-17 09:00:00	
882	2010-01-17 09:30:00	He lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was quiet, maybe that was a good sign.
883	2010-01-17 10:00:00	Then there was someone at the door.
884	2010-01-17 10:30:00	The maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so that Grete would have to go and answer it.
885	2010-01-17 11:00:00	His father had arrived home.
886	2010-01-17 11:30:00	"What's happened?" were his first words;
887	2010-01-17 12:00:00	Grete's appearance must have made everything clear to him.
888	2010-01-17 12:30:00	She answered him with subdued voice, and openly pressed her face into his chest: "Mother's fainted, but she's better now.
889	2010-01-17 13:00:00	Gregor got out." "Just as I expected", said his father, "just as I always said, but you women wouldn't listen, would you."
890	2010-01-17 13:30:00	It was clear to Gregor that Grete had not said enough and that his father took it to mean that something bad had happened,
891	2010-01-17 14:00:00	that he was responsible for some act of violence.
892	2010-01-17 14:30:00	That meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father,
893	2010-01-17 15:00:00	as he did not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been possible.
894	2010-01-17 15:30:00	So he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself against it so that his father, when he came in from the hall,
895	2010-01-17 16:00:00	could see straight away that Gregor had the best intentions and would go back into his room without delay,
896	2010-01-17 16:30:00	that it would not be necessary to drive him back but that they had only to open the door and he would disappear.
897	2010-01-18 09:00:00	
898	2010-01-18 09:30:00	His father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like that;
899	2010-01-18 10:00:00	"Ah!", he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both angry and glad at the same time.
900	2010-01-18 10:30:00	Gregor drew his head back from the door and lifted it towards his father.
901	2010-01-18 11:00:00	He really had not imagined his father the way he stood there now;
902	2010-01-18 11:30:00	of late, with his new habit of crawling about,
903	2010-01-18 12:00:00	he had neglected to pay attention to what was going on the rest of the flat the way he had done before.
904	2010-01-18 12:30:00	He really ought to have expected things to have changed, but still, still, was that really his father?
905	2010-01-18 13:00:00	The same tired man as used to be laying there entombed in his bed when Gregor came back from his business trips,
906	2010-01-18 13:30:00	who would receive him sitting in the armchair in his nightgown when he came back in the evenings;
907	2010-01-18 14:00:00	who was hardly even able to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would just raise his arms and who,
908	2010-01-18 14:30:00	on the couple of times a year when they went for a walk together on
909	2010-01-18 14:30:00	a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly in his overcoat between Gregor and his mother,
910	2010-01-18 15:00:00	would always labour his way forward a little more slowly than them, who were already walking slowly for his sake;
911	2010-01-18 15:30:00	who would place his stick down carefully and, if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his companions around him.
912	2010-01-18 16:00:00	He was standing up straight enough now;
913	2010-01-18 16:30:00	dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the employees at the banking institute;
914	2010-01-18 17:00:00	above the high, stiff collar of the coat his strong double-chin emerged;
915	2010-01-18 17:30:00	under the bushy eyebrows, his piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert;
916	2010-01-18 18:00:00	his normally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp.
917	2010-01-18 18:30:00	He took his cap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some bank, and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa,
918	2010-01-18 19:00:00	put his hands in his trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his long uniform coat, and, with look of determination,
919	2010-01-18 19:30:00	walked towards Gregor.
920	2010-01-18 20:00:00	He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind, but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high.
921	2010-01-18 20:30:00	Gregor was amazed at the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no time with that - he knew full well,
922	2010-01-18 21:00:00	right from the first day of his new life, that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely strict with him.
923	2010-01-18 21:30:00	And so he ran up to his father, stopped when his father stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved, even slightly.
924	2010-01-18 22:00:00	In this way they went round the room several times without anything decisive happening,
925	2010-01-18 22:30:00	without even giving the impression of a chase as everything went so slowly.
926	2010-01-18 23:00:00	Gregor remained all this time on the floor,
927	2010-01-18 23:30:00	largely because he feared his father might see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or ceiling.
928	2010-01-19 00:00:00	Whatever he did, Gregor had to admit that he certainly would not be able to keep up this running about for long,
929	2010-01-19 00:30:00	as for each step his father took he had to carry out countless movements.
930	2010-01-19 01:00:00	He became noticeably short of breath, even in his earlier life his lungs had not been very reliable.
931	2010-01-19 01:30:00	Now, as he lurched about in his efforts to muster all the strength he could for running he could hardly keep his eyes open;
932	2010-01-19 02:00:00	his thoughts became too slow for him to think of any other way of saving himself than running;
933	2010-01-19 02:30:00	he almost forgot that the walls were there for him to use although, here,
934	2010-01-19 03:00:00	they were concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches and protrusions - then, right beside him, lightly tossed,
935	2010-01-19 03:30:00	something flew down and rolled in front of him.
936	2010-01-19 04:00:00	It was an apple;
937	2010-01-19 04:30:00	then another one immediately flew at him;
938	2010-01-19 05:00:00	Gregor froze in shock;
939	2010-01-19 05:30:00	there was no longer any point in running as his father had decided to bombard him.
940	2010-01-19 06:00:00	He had filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and now, without even taking the time for careful aim,
941	2010-01-19 06:30:00	threw one apple after another.
942	2010-01-19 07:00:00	These little, red apples rolled about on the floor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors.
943	2010-01-19 07:30:00	An apple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor's back and slid off without doing any harm.
944	2010-01-19 08:00:00	Another one however, immediately following it, hit squarely and lodged in his back;
945	2010-01-19 08:30:00	Gregor wanted to drag himself away, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible pain by changing his position;
946	2010-01-19 09:00:00	but he felt as if nailed to the spot and spread himself out, all his senses in confusion.
947	2010-01-19 09:30:00	The last thing he saw was the door of his room being pulled open, his sister was screaming,
948	2010-01-19 10:00:00	his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as his sister had taken
949	2010-01-19 10:00:00	off some of her clothes after she had fainted to make it easier for her to breathe),
950	2010-01-19 10:30:00	she ran to his father, her skirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground,
951	2010-01-19 11:00:00	stumbling over the skirts she pushed herself to his father, her arms around him, uniting herself with him totally -
952	2010-01-19 11:30:00	now Gregor lost his ability to see anything - her hands behind his father's head begging him to spare Gregor's life.
953	2010-01-20 09:00:00	
954	2010-01-20 09:30:00	== III ==
955	2010-01-20 10:00:00	No-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor's flesh, so it remained there as a visible reminder of his injury.
956	2010-01-20 10:30:00	He had suffered it there for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious enough to remind even his father that Gregor,
957	2010-01-20 11:00:00	despite his current sad and revolting form, was a family member who could not be treated as an enemy.
958	2010-01-20 11:30:00	On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to swallow any revulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.
959	2010-01-21 09:00:00	
960	2010-01-21 09:30:00	Because of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility - probably permanently.
961	2010-01-21 10:00:00	He had been reduced to the condition of an ancient invalid and it took him long, long minutes to crawl across his room -
962	2010-01-21 10:30:00	crawling over the ceiling was out of the question -
963	2010-01-21 11:00:00	but this deterioration in his condition was fully (in his opinion) made up for by the door to the living room being left open every evening.
964	2010-01-21 11:30:00	He got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours before it was opened and then,
965	2010-01-21 12:00:00	lying in the darkness of his room where he could not be seen from the living room,
966	2010-01-21 12:30:00	he could watch the family in the light of the dinner table and listen to their conversation - with everyone's permission, in a way,
967	2010-01-21 13:00:00	and thus quite differently from before.
968	2010-01-22 09:00:00	
969	2010-01-22 09:30:00	They no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of course,
970	2010-01-22 10:00:00	the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when he was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room.
971	2010-01-22 10:30:00	All of them were usually very quiet nowadays.
972	2010-01-22 11:00:00	Soon after dinner, his father would go to sleep in his chair;
973	2010-01-22 11:30:00	his mother and sister would urge each other to be quiet;
974	2010-01-22 12:00:00	his mother, bent deeply under the lamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop;
975	2010-01-22 12:30:00	his sister, who had taken a sales job,
976	2010-01-22 13:00:00	learned shorthand and French in the evenings so that she might be able to get a better position later on.
977	2010-01-22 13:30:00	Sometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregor's mother "you're doing so much sewing again today!",
978	2010-01-22 14:00:00	as if he did not know that he had been dozing -
979	2010-01-22 14:30:00	and then he would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin.
980	2010-01-23 09:00:00	
981	2010-01-23 09:30:00	With a kind of stubbornness, Gregor's father refused to take his uniform off even at home;
982	2010-01-23 10:00:00	while his nightgown hung unused on its peg Gregor's father would slumber where he was, fully dressed,
983	2010-01-23 10:30:00	as if always ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his superior even here.
984	2010-01-23 11:00:00	The uniform had not been new to start with,
985	2010-01-23 11:30:00	but as a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite the efforts of Gregor's mother and sister to look after it.
986	2010-01-23 12:00:00	Gregor would often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on this coat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny,
987	2010-01-23 12:30:00	while the old man in it would sleep, highly uncomfortable but peaceful.
988	2010-01-24 09:00:00	
989	2010-01-24 09:30:00	As soon as it struck ten, Gregor's mother would speak gently to his father to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed,
990	2010-01-24 10:00:00	as he couldn't sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his sleep if he was to be up at six to get to work.
991	2010-01-24 10:30:00	But since he had been in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on staying longer at the table,
992	2010-01-24 11:00:00	even though he regularly fell asleep and it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the chair for his bed.
993	2010-01-24 11:30:00	Then,
994	2010-01-24 12:00:00	however much mother and sister would importune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep slowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes closed and refusing to get up.
995	2010-01-24 12:30:00	Gregor's mother would tug at his sleeve, whisper endearments into his ear, Gregor's sister would leave her work to help her mother,
996	2010-01-24 13:00:00	but nothing would have any effect on him.
997	2010-01-24 13:30:00	He would just sink deeper into his chair.
998	2010-01-24 14:00:00	Only when the two women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes, look at them one after the other and say: "What a life!
999	2010-01-24 14:30:00	This is what peace I get in my old age!"
1000	2010-01-24 15:00:00	And supported by the two women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself,
1001	2010-01-24 15:30:00	let the women take him to the door,
1002	2010-01-24 16:00:00	send them off and carry on by himself while Gregor's mother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and continue being of help to him.
1003	2010-01-25 09:00:00	
1004	2010-01-25 09:30:00	Who, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to give more attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary?
1005	2010-01-25 10:00:00	The household budget became even smaller;
1006	2010-01-25 10:30:00	so now the maid was dismissed;
1007	2010-01-25 11:00:00	an enormous, thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest work;
1008	2010-01-25 11:30:00	everything else was looked after by Gregor's mother on top of the large amount of sewing work she did.
1009	2010-01-25 12:00:00	Gregor even learned, listening to the evening conversation about what price they had hoped for,
1010	2010-01-25 12:30:00	that several items of jewellery belonging to the family had been sold,
1011	2010-01-25 13:00:00	even though both mother and sister had been very fond of wearing them at functions and celebrations.
1012	2010-01-25 13:30:00	But the loudest complaint was that although the flat was much too big for their present circumstances, they could not move out of it,
1013	2010-01-25 14:00:00	there was no imaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address.
1014	2010-01-25 14:30:00	He could see quite well, though, that there were more reasons than consideration for him that made it difficult for them to move,
1015	2010-01-25 15:00:00	it would have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate with a few air holes in it;
1016	2010-01-25 15:30:00	the main thing holding the family back from their decision to move was much more to do with their total despair,
1017	2010-01-25 16:00:00	and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune unlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related to.
1018	2010-01-25 16:30:00	They carried out absolutely everything that the world expects from poor people, Gregor's father brought bank employees their breakfast,
1019	2010-01-25 17:00:00	his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for strangers,
1020	2010-01-25 17:30:00	his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the behest of the customers, but they just did not have the strength to do any more.
1021	2010-01-25 18:00:00	And the injury in Gregor's back began to hurt as much as when it was new.
1022	2010-01-25 18:30:00	After they had come back from taking his father to bed Gregor's mother
1023	2010-01-25 18:30:00	and sister would now leave their work where it was and sit close together,
1024	2010-01-25 19:00:00	cheek to cheek;
1025	2010-01-25 19:30:00	his mother would point to Gregor's room and say "Close that door, Grete", and then, when he was in the dark again,
1026	2010-01-25 20:00:00	they would sit in the next room and their tears would mingle, or they would simply sit there staring dry-eyed at the table.
1027	2010-01-26 09:00:00	
1028	2010-01-26 09:30:00	Gregor hardly slept at all, either night or day.
1029	2010-01-26 10:00:00	Sometimes he would think of taking over the family's affairs, just like before, the next time the door was opened;
1030	2010-01-26 10:30:00	he had long forgotten about his boss and the chief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts, the salesmen and the apprentices,
1031	2010-01-26 11:00:00	that stupid teaboy, two or three friends from other businesses, one of the chambermaids from a provincial hotel,
1032	2010-01-26 11:30:00	a tender memory that appeared and disappeared again, a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been serious but too slow, -
1033	2010-01-26 12:00:00	all of them appeared to him, mixed together with strangers and others he had forgotten,
1034	2010-01-26 12:30:00	but instead of helping him and his family they were all of them inaccessible, and he was glad when they disappeared.
1035	2010-01-26 13:00:00	Other times he was not at all in the mood to look after his family, he was filled with simple rage about the lack of attention he was shown,
1036	2010-01-26 13:30:00	and although he could think of nothing he would have wanted,
1037	2010-01-26 14:00:00	he made plans of how he could get into the pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to, even if he was not hungry.
1038	2010-01-26 14:30:00	Gregor's sister no longer thought about how she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or
1039	2010-01-26 14:30:00	other into his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the morning and at midday,
1040	2010-01-26 15:00:00	and in the evening she would sweep it away again with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or - more often than not -
1041	2010-01-26 15:30:00	had been left totally untouched.
1042	2010-01-26 16:00:00	She still cleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been any quicker about it.
1043	2010-01-26 16:30:00	Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here and there were little balls of dust and filth.
1044	2010-01-26 17:00:00	At first, Gregor went into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived as a reproach to her,
1045	2010-01-26 17:30:00	but he could have stayed there for weeks without his sister doing anything about it;
1046	2010-01-26 18:00:00	she could see the dirt as well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it.
1047	2010-01-26 18:30:00	At the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for her and which everyone in the family understood -
1048	2010-01-26 19:00:00	cleaning up Gregor's room was for her and her alone.
1049	2010-01-26 19:30:00	Gregor's mother did once thoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several bucketfuls of water to do it -
1050	2010-01-26 20:00:00	although that much dampness also made Gregor ill and he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile.
1051	2010-01-26 20:30:00	But his mother was to be punished still more for what she had done,
1052	2010-01-26 21:00:00	as hardly had his sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the change in Gregor's room and, highly aggrieved,
1053	2010-01-26 21:30:00	ran back into the living room where, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, she broke into convulsive tears.
1054	2010-01-26 22:00:00	Her father, of course, was startled out of his chair and the two parents looked on astonished and helpless;
1055	2010-01-26 22:30:00	then they, too, became agitated;
1056	2010-01-26 23:00:00	Gregor's father, standing to the right of his mother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning of Gregor's room to his sister;
1057	2010-01-26 23:30:00	from her left, Gregor's sister screamed at her that she was never to clean Gregor's room again;
1058	2010-01-27 00:00:00	while his mother tried to draw his father, who was beside himself with anger, into the bedroom;
1059	2010-01-27 00:30:00	his sister, quaking with tears, thumped on the table with her small fists;
1060	2010-01-27 01:00:00	and Gregor hissed in anger that no-one had even thought of closing the door to save him the sight of this and all its noise.
1061	2010-01-28 09:00:00	
1062	2010-01-28 09:30:00	Gregor's sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking after Gregor as she had done before was even more work for her,
1063	2010-01-28 10:00:00	but even so his mother ought certainly not to have taken her place.
1064	2010-01-28 10:30:00	Gregor, on the other hand, ought not to be neglected.
1065	2010-01-28 11:00:00	Now, though, the charwoman was here.
1066	2010-01-28 11:30:00	This elderly widow, with a robust bone structure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things in her long life,
1067	2010-01-28 12:00:00	wasn't really repelled by Gregor.
1068	2010-01-28 12:30:00	Just by chance one day, rather than any real curiosity, she opened the door to Gregor's room and found herself face to face with him.
1069	2010-01-28 13:00:00	He was taken totally by surprise,
1070	2010-01-28 13:30:00	no-one was chasing him but he began to rush to and fro while she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in front of her.
1071	2010-01-28 14:00:00	From then on she never failed to open the door slightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him.
1072	2010-01-28 14:30:00	At first she would call to him as she did so with words that she probably considered friendly, such as "come on then, you old dung-beetle!",
1073	2010-01-28 15:00:00	or "look at the old dung-beetle there!" Gregor never responded to being spoken to in that way,
1074	2010-01-28 15:30:00	but just remained where he was without moving as if the door had never even been opened.
1075	2010-01-28 16:00:00	If only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every day instead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt like it!
1076	2010-01-28 16:30:00	One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the windowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming,
1077	2010-01-28 17:00:00	she began to speak to him in that way once again.
1078	2010-01-28 17:30:00	Gregor was so resentful of it that he started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but it was like a kind of attack.
1079	2010-01-28 18:00:00	Instead of being afraid, the charwoman just lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there with her mouth open,
1080	2010-01-28 18:30:00	clearly intending not to close her mouth until the chair in her hand had been slammed down into Gregor's back.
1081	2010-01-28 19:00:00	"Aren't you coming any closer, then?", she asked when Gregor turned round again, and she calmly put the chair back in the corner.
1082	2010-01-29 09:00:00	
1083	2010-01-29 09:30:00	Gregor had almost entirely stopped eating.
1084	2010-01-29 10:00:00	Only if he happened to find himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he might take some of it into his mouth to play with it,
1085	2010-01-29 10:30:00	leave it there a few hours and then, more often than not, spit it out again.
1086	2010-01-29 11:00:00	At first he thought it was distress at the state of his room that stopped him eating, but he had soon got used to the changes made there.
1087	2010-01-29 11:30:00	They had got into the habit of putting things into this room that they had no room for anywhere else,
1088	2010-01-29 12:00:00	and there were now many such things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to three gentlemen.
1089	2010-01-29 12:30:00	These earnest gentlemen - all three of them had full beards, as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the door one day -
1090	2010-01-29 13:00:00	were painfully insistent on things' being tidy.
1091	2010-01-29 13:30:00	This meant not only in their own room but, since they had taken a room in this establishment,
1092	2010-01-29 14:00:00	in the entire flat and especially in the kitchen.
1093	2010-01-29 14:30:00	Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate, especially if it was dirty.
1094	2010-01-29 15:00:00	They had moreover brought most of their own furnishings and equipment with them.
1095	2010-01-29 15:30:00	For this reason, many things had become superfluous which, although they could not be sold, the family did not wish to discard.
1096	2010-01-29 16:00:00	All these things found their way into Gregor's room.
1097	2010-01-29 16:30:00	The dustbins from the kitchen found their way in there too.
1098	2010-01-29 17:00:00	The charwoman was always in a hurry, and anything she couldn't use for the time being she would just chuck in there.
1099	2010-01-29 17:30:00	He, fortunately, would usually see no more than the object and the hand that held it.
1100	2010-01-29 18:00:00	The woman most likely meant to fetch the things back out again when she had time and the opportunity, or to throw everything out in one go,
1101	2010-01-29 18:30:00	but what actually happened was that they were left where they landed when they had first been thrown unless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere else.
1102	2010-01-29 19:00:00	At first he moved it because, with no other room free where he could crawl about, he was forced to,
1103	2010-01-29 19:30:00	but later on he came to enjoy it although moving about in the way left him sad and tired to death and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards.
1104	2010-01-30 09:00:00	
1105	2010-01-30 09:30:00	The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening meal at home in the living room that was used by everyone,
1106	2010-01-30 10:00:00	and so the door to this room was often kept closed in the evening.
1107	2010-01-30 10:30:00	But Gregor found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after all, often failed to make use of it when it was open and,
1108	2010-01-30 11:00:00	without the family having noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner.
1109	2010-01-30 11:30:00	One time, though, the charwoman left the door to the living room slightly open,
1110	2010-01-30 12:00:00	and it remained open when the gentlemen who rented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on.
1111	2010-01-30 12:30:00	They sat up at the table where, formerly, Gregor had taken his meals with his father and mother,
1112	2010-01-30 13:00:00	they unfolded the serviettes and picked up their knives and forks.
1113	2010-01-30 13:30:00	Gregor's mother immediately appeared in the doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sister with a dish piled high with potatoes.
1114	2010-01-30 14:00:00	The food was steaming, and filled the room with its smell.
1115	2010-01-30 14:30:00	The gentlemen bent over the dishes set in front of them as if they wanted to test the food before eating it,
1116	2010-01-30 15:00:00	and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to count as an authority for the other two,
1117	2010-01-30 15:30:00	did indeed cut off a piece of meat while it was still in its dish,
1118	2010-01-30 16:00:00	clearly wishing to establish whether it was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the kitchen.
1119	2010-01-30 16:30:00	It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor's mother and sister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again and smiled.
1120	2010-01-31 09:00:00	
1121	2010-01-31 09:30:00	The family themselves ate in the kitchen.
1122	2010-01-31 10:00:00	Nonetheless, Gregor's father came into the living room before he went into the kitchen,
1123	2010-01-31 10:30:00	bowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table.
1124	2010-01-31 11:00:00	The gentlemen stood as one, and mumbled something into their beards.
1125	2010-01-31 11:30:00	Then, once they were alone, they ate in near perfect silence.
1126	2010-01-31 12:00:00	It seemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises of eating their chewing teeth could still be heard,
1127	2010-01-31 12:30:00	as if they had wanted to Show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was not possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless however nice they might be.
1128	2010-01-31 13:00:00	"I'd like to eat something", said Gregor anxiously, "but not anything like they're eating.
1129	2010-01-31 13:30:00	They do feed themselves.
1130	2010-01-31 14:00:00	And here I am, dying!"
1131	2010-02-01 09:00:00	
1132	2010-02-01 09:30:00	Throughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the violin being played,
1133	2010-02-01 10:00:00	but this evening it began to be heard from the kitchen.
1134	2010-02-01 10:30:00	The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the one in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of the others,
1135	2010-02-01 11:00:00	and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and smoking.
1136	2010-02-01 11:30:00	When the violin began playing they became attentive,
1137	2010-02-01 12:00:00	stood up and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they stood pressed against each other.
1138	2010-02-01 12:30:00	Someone must have heard them in the kitchen, as Gregor's father called out: "Is the playing perhaps unpleasant for the gentlemen?
1139	2010-02-01 13:00:00	We can stop it straight away." "On the contrary", said the middle gentleman,
1140	2010-02-01 13:30:00	"would the young lady not like to come in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after all, much more cosy and comfortable?"
1141	2010-02-01 14:00:00	"Oh yes, we'd love to", called back Gregor's father as if he had been the violin player himself.
1142	2010-02-01 14:30:00	The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited.
1143	2010-02-01 15:00:00	Gregor's father soon appeared with the music stand, his mother with the music and his sister with the violin.
1144	2010-02-01 15:30:00	She calmly prepared everything for her to begin playing;
1145	2010-02-01 16:00:00	his parents, who had never rented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated courtesy towards the three gentlemen,
1146	2010-02-01 16:30:00	did not even dare to sit on their own chairs;
1147	2010-02-01 17:00:00	his father leant against the door with his right hand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat;
1148	2010-02-01 17:30:00	his mother, though, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat - leaving the chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it -
1149	2010-02-01 18:00:00	out of the way in a corner.
1150	2010-02-02 09:00:00	
1151	2010-02-02 09:30:00	His sister began to play;
1152	2010-02-02 10:00:00	father and mother paid close attention, one on each side, to the movements of her hands.
1153	2010-02-02 10:30:00	Drawn in by the playing, Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had his head in the living room.
1154	2010-02-02 11:00:00	Before,
1155	2010-02-02 11:30:00	he had taken great pride in how considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had become so thoughtless about the others.
1156	2010-02-02 12:00:00	What's more,
1157	2010-02-02 12:30:00	there was now all the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the dust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest movement;
1158	2010-02-02 13:00:00	he carried threads, hairs, and remains of food about on his back and sides;
1159	2010-02-02 13:30:00	he was much too indifferent to everything now to lay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had used to do several times a day.
1160	2010-02-02 14:00:00	And despite this condition, he was not too shy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the living room.
1161	2010-02-03 09:00:00	
1162	2010-02-03 09:30:00	No-one noticed him, though.
1163	2010-02-03 10:00:00	The family was totally preoccupied with the violin playing;
1164	2010-02-03 10:30:00	at first,
1165	2010-02-03 11:00:00	the three gentlemen had put their hands in their pockets and come up far
1166	2010-02-03 11:00:00	too close behind the music stand to look at all the notes being played,
1167	2010-02-03 11:30:00	and they must have disturbed Gregor's sister, but soon, in contrast with the family,
1168	2010-02-03 12:00:00	they  withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talking to each other at half volume,
1169	2010-02-03 12:30:00	and they stayed by the window while Gregor's father observed them anxiously.
1170	2010-02-03 13:00:00	It really now seemed very obvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or entertaining violin playing but had been disappointed,
1171	2010-02-03 13:30:00	that they had had enough of the whole performance and it was only now out of politeness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed.
1172	2010-02-03 14:00:00	It was especially unnerving, the way they all blew the smoke from their cigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses.
1173	2010-02-03 14:30:00	Yet Gregor's sister was playing so beautifully.
1174	2010-02-03 15:00:00	Her face was leant to one side, following the lines of music with a careful and melancholy expression.
1175	2010-02-03 15:30:00	Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his head close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the chance came.
1176	2010-02-03 16:00:00	Was he an animal if music could captivate him so?
1177	2010-02-03 16:30:00	It seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he had been yearning for.
1178	2010-02-03 17:00:00	He was determined to make his way forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might come into his room with her violin,
1179	2010-02-03 17:30:00	as no-one appreciated her playing here as much as he would.
1180	2010-02-03 18:00:00	He never wanted to let her out of his room, not while he lived, anyway;
1181	2010-02-03 18:30:00	his shocking appearance should, for once, be of some use to him;
1182	2010-02-03 19:00:00	he wanted to be at every door of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers;
1183	2010-02-03 19:30:00	his sister should not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay of her own free will;
1184	2010-02-03 20:00:00	she would sit beside him on the couch with her ear bent down to him
1185	2010-02-03 20:00:00	while he told her how he had always intended to send her to the conservatory,
1186	2010-02-03 20:30:00	how he would have told everyone about it last Christmas - had Christmas really come and gone already?
1187	2010-02-03 21:00:00	- if this misfortune hadn't got in the way, and refuse to let anyone dissuade him from it.
1188	2010-02-03 21:30:00	On hearing all this, his sister would break out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder and kiss her neck, which,
1189	2010-02-03 22:00:00	since she had been going out to work, she had kept free without any necklace or collar.
1190	2010-02-04 09:00:00	
1191	2010-02-04 09:30:00	"Mr. Samsa!", shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor's father, pointing, without wasting any more words,
1192	2010-02-04 10:00:00	with his forefinger at Gregor as he slowly moved forward.
1193	2010-02-04 10:30:00	The violin went silent, the middle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends, shaking his head, and then looked back at Gregor.
1194	2010-02-04 11:00:00	His father seemed to think it more important to calm the three gentlemen before driving Gregor out,
1195	2010-02-04 11:30:00	even though they were not at all upset and seemed to think Gregor was more entertaining that the violin playing had been.
1196	2010-02-04 12:00:00	He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and attempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as trying to block their view of Gregor with his body.
1197	2010-02-04 12:30:00	Now they did become a little annoyed,
1198	2010-02-04 13:00:00	and it was not clear whether it was his father's behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that they had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room without knowing it.
1199	2010-02-04 13:30:00	They asked Gregor's father for explanations, raised their arms like he had,
1200	2010-02-04 14:00:00	tugged excitedly at their beards and moved back towards their room only very slowly.
1201	2010-02-04 14:30:00	Meanwhile Gregor's sister had overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was suddenly interrupted.
1202	2010-02-04 15:00:00	She had let her hands drop and let violin and bow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if still playing,
1203	2010-02-04 15:30:00	but then she suddenly pulled herself together,
1204	2010-02-04 16:00:00	lay the instrument on her mother's lap who still sat laboriously struggling for breath where she was, and ran into the next room which,
1205	2010-02-04 16:30:00	under pressure from her father, the three gentlemen were more quickly moving toward.
1206	2010-02-04 17:00:00	Under his sister's experienced hand,
1207	2010-02-04 17:30:00	the pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and she had already finished making the beds and slipped out again before the three gentlemen had reached the room.
1208	2010-02-04 18:00:00	Gregor's father seemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the respect he owed to his tenants.
1209	2010-02-04 18:30:00	He urged them and pressed them until, when he was already at the door of the room,
1210	2010-02-04 19:00:00	the middle of the three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and thereby brought Gregor's father to a halt.
1211	2010-02-04 19:30:00	"I declare here and now", he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor's mother and sister to gain their attention too,
1212	2010-02-04 20:00:00	"that with regard to the repugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family" -
1213	2010-02-04 20:30:00	here he looked briefly but decisively at the floor - "I give immediate notice on my room.
1214	2010-02-04 21:00:00	For the days that I have been living here I will, of course, pay nothing at all,
1215	2010-02-04 21:30:00	on the contrary I will consider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages from you,
1216	2010-02-04 22:00:00	and believe me it would be very easy to set out the grounds for such an action."
1217	2010-02-04 22:30:00	He was silent and looked straight ahead as if waiting for something.
1218	2010-02-04 23:00:00	And indeed, his two friends joined in with the words: "And we also give immediate notice." With that,
1219	2010-02-04 23:30:00	he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door.
1220	2010-02-05 09:00:00	
1221	2010-02-05 09:30:00	Gregor's father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his hands, and fell into it;
1222	2010-02-05 10:00:00	it looked as if he was stretching himself out for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all.
1223	2010-02-05 10:30:00	Throughout all this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen had first seen him.
1224	2010-02-05 11:00:00	His disappointment at the failure of his plan, and perhaps also because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible for him to move.
1225	2010-02-05 11:30:00	He was sure that everyone would turn on him any moment, and he waited.
1226	2010-02-05 12:00:00	He was not even startled out of this state when the violin on his mother's lap fell from her trembling fingers and landed loudly on the floor.
1227	2010-02-06 09:00:00	
1228	2010-02-06 09:30:00	"Father, Mother", said his sister, hitting the table with her hand as introduction, "we can't carry on like this.
1229	2010-02-06 10:00:00	Maybe you can't see it, but I can.
1230	2010-02-06 10:30:00	I don't want to call this monster my brother, all I can say is: we have to try and get rid of it.
1231	2010-02-06 11:00:00	We've done all that's humanly possible to look after it and be patient, I don't think anyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong."
1232	2010-02-07 09:00:00	
1233	2010-02-07 09:30:00	"She's absolutely right", said Gregor's father to himself.
1234	2010-02-07 10:00:00	His mother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began to cough dully,
1235	2010-02-07 10:30:00	her hand held out in front of her and a deranged expression in her eyes.
1236	2010-02-08 09:00:00	
1237	2010-02-08 09:30:00	Gregor's sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her forehead.
1238	2010-02-08 10:00:00	Her words seemed to give Gregor's father some more definite ideas.
1239	2010-02-08 10:30:00	He sat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal,
1240	2010-02-08 11:00:00	and occasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobile.
1241	2010-02-09 09:00:00	
1242	2010-02-09 09:30:00	"We have to try and get rid of it", said Gregor's sister, now speaking only to her father,
1243	2010-02-09 10:00:00	as her mother was too occupied with coughing to listen, "it'll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming.
1244	2010-02-09 10:30:00	We can't all work as hard as we have to and then come home to be tortured like this, we can't endure it.
1245	2010-02-09 11:00:00	I can't endure it any more." And she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down the face of her mother,
1246	2010-02-09 11:30:00	and she wiped them away with mechanical hand movements.
1247	2010-02-10 09:00:00	
1248	2010-02-10 09:30:00	"My child", said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding, "what are we to do?"
1249	2010-02-11 09:00:00	
1250	2010-02-11 09:30:00	His sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness and tears that had taken hold of her, displacing her earlier certainty.
1251	2010-02-12 09:00:00	
1252	2010-02-12 09:30:00	"If he could just understand us", said his father almost as a question;
1253	2010-02-12 10:00:00	his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as a sign that of that there was no question.
1254	2010-02-13 09:00:00	
1255	2010-02-13 09:30:00	"If he could just understand us", repeated Gregor's father,
1256	2010-02-13 10:00:00	closing his eyes in acceptance of his sister's certainty that that was quite impossible,
1257	2010-02-13 10:30:00	"then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement with him.
1258	2010-02-13 11:00:00	But as it is ..."
1259	2010-02-14 09:00:00	
1260	2010-02-14 09:30:00	"It's got to go", shouted his sister, "that's the only way, Father.
1261	2010-02-14 10:00:00	You've got to get rid of the idea that that's Gregor.
1262	2010-02-14 10:30:00	We've only harmed ourselves by believing it for so long.
1263	2010-02-14 11:00:00	How can that be Gregor?
1264	2010-02-14 11:30:00	If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it's not possible for human beings to live with an animal like that and he would have gone of his own free will.
1265	2010-02-14 12:00:00	We wouldn't have a brother any more, then, but we could carry on with our lives and remember him with respect.
1266	2010-02-14 12:30:00	As it is this animal is persecuting us, it's driven out our tenants,
1267	2010-02-14 13:00:00	it obviously wants to take over the whole flat and force us to sleep on the streets.
1268	2010-02-14 13:30:00	Father, look, just look", she suddenly screamed, "he's starting again!" In her alarm, which was totally beyond Gregor's comprehension,
1269	2010-02-14 14:00:00	his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stay anywhere near Gregor.
1270	2010-02-14 14:30:00	She rushed over to behind her father,
1271	2010-02-14 15:00:00	who had become excited merely because she was and stood up half raising his hands in front of Gregor's sister as if to protect her.
1272	2010-02-15 09:00:00	
1273	2010-02-15 09:30:00	But Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all his sister.
1274	2010-02-15 10:00:00	All he had done was begin to turn round so that he could go back into his room,
1275	2010-02-15 10:30:00	although that was in itself quite startling as his pain-wracked condition meant that turning round required
1276	2010-02-15 10:30:00	a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help himself do it,
1277	2010-02-15 11:00:00	repeatedly raising it and striking it against the floor.
1278	2010-02-15 11:30:00	He stopped and looked round.
1279	2010-02-15 12:00:00	They seemed to have realised his good intention and had only been alarmed briefly.
1280	2010-02-15 12:30:00	Now they all looked at him in unhappy silence.
1281	2010-02-15 13:00:00	His mother lay in her chair with her legs stretched out and pressed against each other, her eyes nearly closed with exhaustion;
1282	2010-02-15 13:30:00	his sister sat next to his father with her arms around his neck.
1283	2010-02-16 09:00:00	
1284	2010-02-16 09:30:00	"Maybe now they'll let me turn round", thought Gregor and went back to work.
1285	2010-02-16 10:00:00	He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had sometimes to stop and take a rest.
1286	2010-02-16 10:30:00	No-one was making him rush any more, everything was left up to him.
1287	2010-02-16 11:00:00	As soon as he had finally finished turning round he began to move straight ahead.
1288	2010-02-16 11:30:00	He was amazed at the great distance that separated him from his room,
1289	2010-02-16 12:00:00	and could not understand how he had covered that distance in his weak state a little while before and almost without noticing it.
1290	2010-02-16 12:30:00	He concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that there was not a word, not any cry, from his family to distract him.
1291	2010-02-16 13:00:00	He did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway.
1292	2010-02-16 13:30:00	He did not turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiff,
1293	2010-02-16 14:00:00	but it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him had changed, only his sister had stood up.
1294	2010-02-16 14:30:00	With his last glance he saw that his mother had now fallen completely asleep.
1295	2010-02-17 09:00:00	
1296	2010-02-17 09:30:00	He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut, bolted and locked.
1297	2010-02-17 10:00:00	The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him that his little legs collapsed under him.
1298	2010-02-17 10:30:00	It was his sister who had been in so much of a rush.
1299	2010-02-17 11:00:00	She had been standing there waiting and sprung forward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all,
1300	2010-02-17 11:30:00	and as she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents "At last!".
1301	2010-02-18 09:00:00	
1302	2010-02-18 09:30:00	"What now, then?", Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the darkness.
1303	2010-02-18 10:00:00	He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move at all.
1304	2010-02-18 10:30:00	This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being able to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then was unnatural.
1305	2010-02-18 11:00:00	He also felt relatively comfortable.
1306	2010-02-18 11:30:00	It is true that his entire body was aching,
1307	2010-02-18 12:00:00	but the pain seemed to be slowly getting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether.
1308	2010-02-18 12:30:00	He could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust.
1309	2010-02-18 13:00:00	He thought back of his family with emotion and love.
1310	2010-02-18 13:30:00	If it was possible, he felt that he must go away even more strongly than his sister.
1311	2010-02-18 14:00:00	He remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination until he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning.
1312	2010-02-18 14:30:00	He watched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the window too.
1313	2010-02-18 15:00:00	Then, without his willing it, his head sank down completely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils.
1314	2010-02-19 09:00:00	
1315	2010-02-19 09:30:00	When the cleaner came in early in the morning -
1316	2010-02-19 10:00:00	they'd often asked her not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her hurry she still did,
1317	2010-02-19 10:30:00	so that everyone in the flat knew when she'd arrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace -
1318	2010-02-19 11:00:00	she made her usual brief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing special.
1319	2010-02-19 11:30:00	She thought he was laying there so still on purpose, playing the martyr;
1320	2010-02-19 12:00:00	she attributed all possible understanding to him.
1321	2010-02-19 12:30:00	She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, so she tried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway.
1322	2010-02-19 13:00:00	When she had no success with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked at him a little,
1323	2010-02-19 13:30:00	and only when she found she could shove him across the floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention.
1324	2010-02-19 14:00:00	She soon realised what had really happened, opened her eyes wide, whistled to herself,
1325	2010-02-19 14:30:00	but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom doors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms: "Come and 'ave a look at this,
1326	2010-02-19 15:00:00	it's dead, just lying there, stone dead!"
1327	2010-02-20 09:00:00	
1328	2010-02-20 09:30:00	Mr. and  Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had to make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before they could grasp what she was saying.
1329	2010-02-20 10:00:00	But then, each from his own side, they hurried out of bed.
1330	2010-02-20 10:30:00	Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his shoulders, Mrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress;
1331	2010-02-20 11:00:00	and that is how they went into Gregor's room.
1332	2010-02-20 11:30:00	On the way they opened the door to the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the three gentlemen had moved in;
1333	2010-02-20 12:00:00	she was fully dressed as if she had never been asleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this.
1334	2010-02-20 12:30:00	"Dead?", asked  Mrs. Samsa, looking at the charwoman enquiringly,
1335	2010-02-20 13:00:00	even though she could have checked for herself and could have known it even without checking.
1336	2010-02-20 13:30:00	"That's what I said", replied the cleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor's body another shove with the broom,
1337	2010-02-20 14:00:00	sending it sideways across the floor.
1338	2010-02-20 14:30:00	Mrs. Samsa made a movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but did not complete it.
1339	2010-02-20 15:00:00	"Now then", said  Mr. Samsa, "let's give thanks to God for that".
1340	2010-02-20 15:30:00	He crossed himself, and the three women followed his example.
1341	2010-02-20 16:00:00	Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said: "Just look how thin he was.
1342	2010-02-20 16:30:00	He didn't eat anything for so long.
1343	2010-02-20 17:00:00	The food came out again just the same as when it went in".
1344	2010-02-20 17:30:00	Gregor's body was indeed completely dried up and flat, they had not seen it until then, but now he was not lifted up on his little legs,
1345	2010-02-20 18:00:00	nor did he do anything to make them look away.
1346	2010-02-21 09:00:00	
1347	2010-02-21 09:30:00	"Grete, come with us in here for a little while", said  Mrs. Samsa with a pained smile,
1348	2010-02-21 10:00:00	and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom but not without looking back at the body.
1349	2010-02-21 10:30:00	The cleaner shut the door and opened the window wide.
1350	2010-02-21 11:00:00	Although it was still early in the morning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it.
1351	2010-02-21 11:30:00	It was already the end of March, after all.
1352	2010-02-22 09:00:00	
1353	2010-02-22 09:30:00	The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in amazement for their breakfasts;
1354	2010-02-22 10:00:00	they had been forgotten about.
1355	2010-02-22 10:30:00	"Where is our breakfast?", the middle gentleman asked the cleaner irritably.
1356	2010-02-22 11:00:00	She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and silent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregor's room.
1357	2010-02-22 11:30:00	They did so, and stood around Gregor's corpse with their hands in the pockets of their well-worn coats.
1358	2010-02-22 12:00:00	It was now quite light in the room.
1359	2010-02-23 09:00:00	
1360	2010-02-23 09:30:00	Then the door of the bedroom opened and  Mr. Samsa appeared in his uniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other.
1361	2010-02-23 10:00:00	All of them had been crying a little;
1362	2010-02-23 10:30:00	Grete now and then pressed her face against her father's arm.
1363	2010-02-24 09:00:00	
1364	2010-02-24 09:30:00	"Leave my home.
1365	2010-02-24 10:00:00	Now!", said  Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and without letting the women from him.
1366	2010-02-24 10:30:00	"What do you mean?", asked the middle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled sweetly.
1367	2010-02-24 11:00:00	The other two held their hands behind their backs and continually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud quarrel which could only end in their favour.
1368	2010-02-24 11:30:00	"I mean just what I said", answered  Mr. Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in a straight line towards the man.
1369	2010-02-24 12:00:00	At first, he stood there still, looking at the ground as if the contents of his head were rearranging themselves into new positions.
1370	2010-02-24 12:30:00	"Alright, we'll go then", he said,
1371	2010-02-24 13:00:00	and looked up at  Mr. Samsa as if he had been suddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from Mr. Samsa for his decision.
1372	2010-02-24 13:30:00	Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wide and briefly nodded to him several times.
1373	2010-02-24 14:00:00	At that, and without delay, the man actually did take long strides into the front hallway;
1374	2010-02-24 14:30:00	his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time before and had been listening to what was being said.
1375	2010-02-24 15:00:00	Now they jumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that Mr. Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the connection with their leader.
1376	2010-02-24 15:30:00	Once there, all three took their hats from the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a word and left the premises.
1377	2010-02-24 16:00:00	Mr. Samsa and the two women followed them out onto the landing;
1378	2010-02-24 16:30:00	but they had had no reason to mistrust the men' intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how the three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many steps.
1379	2010-02-24 17:00:00	As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and would reappear a few moments later;
1380	2010-02-24 17:30:00	the further down they went, the more that the Samsa family lost interest in them;
1381	2010-02-24 18:00:00	when a butcher's boy, proud of posture with his tray on his head, passed them on his way up and came nearer than they were,
1382	2010-02-24 18:30:00	Mr. Samsa and the women came away from the landing and went, as if relieved, back into the flat.
1383	2010-02-25 09:00:00	
1384	2010-02-25 09:30:00	They decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation and to go for a walk;
1385	2010-02-25 10:00:00	not only had they earned a break from work but they were in serious need of it.
1386	2010-02-25 10:30:00	So they sat at the table and wrote three letters of excusal, Mr. Samsa to his employers,
1387	2010-02-25 11:00:00	Mrs. Samsa to her contractor and Grete to her principal.
1388	2010-02-25 11:30:00	The cleaner came in while they were writing to tell them she was going, she'd finished her work for that morning.
1389	2010-02-25 12:00:00	The three of them at first just nodded without looking up from what they were writing,
1390	2010-02-25 12:30:00	and it was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation.
1391	2010-02-25 13:00:00	"Well?", asked  Mr. Samsa.
1392	2010-02-25 13:30:00	The charwoman stood in the doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous good news to report,
1393	2010-02-25 14:00:00	but would only do it if she was clearly asked to.
1394	2010-02-25 14:30:00	The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat,
1395	2010-02-25 15:00:00	which had been source of irritation to  Mr. Samsa all the time she had been working for them, swayed gently in all directions.
1396	2010-02-25 15:30:00	"What is it you want then?", asked  Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaner had the most respect for.
1397	2010-02-25 16:00:00	"Yes", she answered, and broke into a friendly laugh that made her unable to speak straight away, "well then, that thing in there,
1398	2010-02-25 16:30:00	you needn't worry about how you're going to get rid of it.
1399	2010-02-25 17:00:00	That's all been sorted out." Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down over their letters as if intent on continuing with what they were writing;
1400	2010-02-25 17:30:00	Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing everything in detail but, with outstretched hand,
1401	2010-02-25 18:00:00	he made it quite clear that she was not to.
1402	2010-02-25 18:30:00	So, as she was prevented from telling them all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and, clearly peeved, called out
1403	2010-02-25 19:00:00	"Cheerio then, everyone", turned round sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.
1404	2010-02-26 09:00:00	
1405	2010-02-26 09:30:00	"Tonight she gets sacked", said  Mr. Samsa,
1406	2010-02-26 10:00:00	but he received no reply from either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have destroyed the peace they had only just gained.
1407	2010-02-26 10:30:00	They got up and went over to the window where they remained with their arms around each other.
1408	2010-02-26 11:00:00	Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat there watching for a while.
1409	2010-02-26 11:30:00	Then he called out: "Come here, then.
1410	2010-02-26 12:00:00	Let's forget about all that old stuff, shall we.
1411	2010-02-26 12:30:00	Come and give me a bit of attention".
1412	2010-02-26 13:00:00	The two women immediately did as he said,
1413	2010-02-26 13:30:00	hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then they quickly finished their letters.
1414	2010-02-27 09:00:00	
1415	2010-02-27 09:30:00	After that, the three of them left the flat together, which was something they had not done for months,
1416	2010-02-27 10:00:00	and took the tram out to the open country outside the town.
1417	2010-02-27 10:30:00	They had the tram, filled with warm sunshine, all to themselves.
1418	2010-02-27 11:00:00	Leant back comfortably on their seats, they discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination they were not at all bad -
1419	2010-02-27 11:30:00	until then they had never asked each other about their work but all three had jobs which were very good and held particularly good promise for the future.
1420	2010-02-27 12:00:00	The greatest improvement for the time being, of course, would be achieved quite easily by moving house;
1421	2010-02-27 12:30:00	what they needed now was a flat that was smaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by Gregor,
1422	2010-02-27 13:00:00	one that was in a better location and, most of all, more practical.
1423	2010-02-27 13:30:00	All the time, Grete was becoming livelier.
1424	2010-02-27 14:00:00	With all the worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but, while they were talking, Mr. and  Mrs. Samsa were struck,
1425	2010-02-27 14:30:00	almost simultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was blossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.
1426	2010-02-27 15:00:00	They became quieter.
1427	2010-02-27 15:30:00	Just from each other's glance and almost without knowing it they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for her.
1428	2010-02-27 16:00:00	And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good intentions,
1429	2010-02-27 16:30:00	as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the first to get up and stretch out her young body.
1430	2010-02-27 17:00:00	== end ==
